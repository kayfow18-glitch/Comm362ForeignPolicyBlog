    <p>
      Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the EU has treated economics in the Union as both an offensive weapon and a defensive shield. Confronted with a full-scale war on the doorstep of its member-states, Brussels has made an effort to gather grants, loans, tariffs, trade regulations, and sanctions and use them as instruments to refine its grand strategy. Using Nina Silove’s (2018) definition of grand strategy as “...something that has the characteristics of being long-term in scope, related to the state’s highest priorities, and concerned with all spheres of statecraft (military, diplomatic, and economic)” (p. 27) makes it apparent that the EU sees its grand strategy towards Ukraine and Russia as paramount. These actions are aimed at one of the EU’s highest political priorities: integrity of the single market. However, the EU’s economic strategy faces significant challenges, including maintaining unity among member states and grappling with the costs of sanctions, as well as the continued massive amounts of aid to Ukraine. Nevertheless, within these challenges lies an opportunity for the EU to strengthen its economic sovereignty and deepen integration within impacted member states, thereby regaining credibility in a fundamental aspect of its grand strategy towards Ukraine and Russia; a notion that some believe has been wavering or has completely ceased to exist.
    </p>
    <p>
    Sanctions on Russia for the EU have been its most prominent offensive economic tool since Russia invaded Ukraine. Early sanctions targeted the finance, energy, transport, and technology sectors, with goods believed to aid the Russian defense sector (Council of the European Union, 2025a). Over time, and with further escalation by Russia, the EU has shifted its sanctions towards more targeted measures aimed at stopping the actual war effort. As of October 23, 2025, current EU sanctions on Russia include sectors such as banking, exports of goods and services, and a complete ban on Russian energy (Council of the European Union, 2025a). The evolving sanction policy that the EU holds towards Russia shows that it no longer sees itself as passive on the sanctions issue; it is growing bolder and more direct with every new declaration. 
    </p>
        <p>
          In addition to sanctions, the EU has strategically deployed offensive tariffs to ensure that Russian entities do not circumvent sanction regulations. In 2024, the EU imposed heavy tariffs on Russia, which had a significant impact. These tariffs were imposed on Russian and Belarusian agricultural products, an industry that is crucial to the Russian and satellite state economies (Brezezinski, 2024). In July 2025, the EU further intensified these sanctions on Russia and Belarus, and new items subject to these tariffs included animals, tobacco, raw textiles, and fertilizers (European Commission, 2025a). These trade mechanisms are designed to reinforce the EU’s broader effort to hinder Russia’s economy and aid Ukraine. 
    </p>

      <p>
        However, these offensive tools definitely come with challenges. Member states already vary in their level of involvement with Russian markets. Some member states are also more dependent on Russian energy and gas exports than others. Consequently, smaller member states closer to the border will likely bear a disproportionate burden due to these sanctions and tariffs. The enforcement of these sanctions and tariffs is also quite inconsistent (Robin & Harris, 2025). So the effectiveness of these policies is hard to measure, leaving the EU in an interesting gray area. While the EU has taken some offensive economic steps since the invasion of Ukraine, it has also been on the defensive to take care of member states at home.
      </p>
          <p>
        Most notably, REPowerEU, launched in 2022, aims for the EU to save energy, diversify energy supplies, and produce clean energy (European Commission, 2025b). The EU has successfully defended itself against Russia's attempts to weaponize energy on the continent, an area of contention for many Europeans. In a subsection of REPowerEU, under AggregateEU, member states have taken the initiative to come together and participate in joint gas purchases at a supranational level, thereby saving member states money because they negotiate lower prices and are less reliant on foreign entities to supply this gas (European Commission, 2025c). By no longer relying on Russia for gas, the EU significantly bolsters its defense footprint, signaling that it no longer needs help powering the continent.
        </p>
    <p>
    The EU has also been able to diversify its supply chain away from Russia. The EU has made it a priority to negotiate trade agreements with countries that can mutually benefit from these agreements, such as Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, and the UK (European Commission, 2025d). More partners for EU member states to make trades with bolsters its defense and its ability to sustain its economy without Russia, something it has not previously been able to do.

    </figure>

    <p>
      All of these defensive strategies aim to unify the EU within its single market. That is the ultimate goal for the EU and one that must be met for the EU to succeed economically. Making the Euro stronger is paramount, but it must be balanced against the reality of internal fragmentation within the EU (European Council, 2025). Far-right governments in the EU, particularly those in Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, have all stated that they will attempt to block any future EU regulations that seek to undermine perceived support for Russia (Vinocur, 2025). This fragmentation reveals internal weakness within the EU, as it is unable to maintain a unified front among its member states, a key weakness that opponents have identified as a flaw in the EU’s attempt to appear integrated. 
      <p>
          <p>  
            The EU has also made an effort to support Ukraine as a form of strategic statecraft, recognizing the potential benefits to Brussels as a whole. Since the beginning of the war, the EU has supplied Ukraine with close to €170 billion to help the country fight against Russia (European Union External Action, 2025). The EU has also pledged €38 billion in recovery efforts for Ukraine following the war. More recently, in an attempt to change the way money is distributed to Ukraine, the EU is considering using frozen Russian assets to fund projects in Ukraine via a loan (Strupczewski, 2025). Moscow has reiterated that if the EU were to go this route, there would be harsh punishment because Russia views this move as illegal. This financial assistance for Ukraine is provided because the EU views Ukraine as a crucial actor in its own defense. The EU does not want Ukraine to fall into Russian control because it would be closer to the heart of the EU and could ultimately lead to a bigger war nobody wants (Bastasin, 2023). As the war continues, the EU will continue to fund Ukraine, but it must be cautious, as member states and their people can only give so much; aid fatigue could become very real without tangible success stories from Ukraine. 
          </p>
    <p>
      Economic support for Ukraine as a form of grand strategy has not been easy for the EU. While there have been many successes, the EU has been hindered in its ability to act due to internal divisions among member states. Recent shifts in governments across the EU have allowed for more Ukraine skeptics to ascend to power. Hungary and Orbán have been steadfast in their unwillingness to support Ukraine and have begun to expand that reach. Orbán wants to ally with Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico and incoming Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš, both of whom are hesitant to support Ukraine (Vinocur, 2025). All three of these leaders echo the same message: the EU is abandoning its current citizens for Ukraine, and that these sanctions and aid undermine the EU’s credibility to support member states. This growing division amongst member states shows weakness and could hinder the EU’s long-term strategic coherence. In a time when Ukraine’s allies are uncertain, weakness is something the EU cannot afford.

    <p>
      The war in Ukraine has undoubtedly been a crisis for the EU, but in times of crisis, excellence can emerge. This crisis has facilitated deeper integration in specific sectors. An area of cooperation where the EU has been mostly unified is the energy sector. The EU aims to reduce its reliance on Russian energy and invest in energy within its own member states (European Commission, 2025e). The EU has also tried to shift its industrial policy away from outsourcing to reinvesting in industrial plants within member states (The Council of the European Union, 2025b). In addition to this, the EU has continued to diversify its international partnerships outside of Russia to generate revenue through trade.
    </p>
      <p>
      These opportunities demonstrate that the EU is confident in its ability to be independent in sectors where it previously relied heavily on Russia. By focusing on this economic sovereignty now, the EU is allowing itself to become even more economically integrated, a goal it desperately wants to achieve by 2030. 
          </p>
  <p>
    All of these factors lead to debates on whether the EU actually possesses a coherent grand strategy towards Ukraine and Russia, or if the collection of policies that have been enacted since the invasion of Ukraine are merely reactionary. The EU’s use of economic statecraft, from sanctions, tariffs, energy independence, and financial assistance to Ukraine, does reflect a long-term strategic vision, something that is needed for a cohesive grand strategy (Grevi, 2023). There has been an unprecedented willingness on the part of the EU to act in its own defense. However, there have been persistent blockages from Hungary regarding support for Ukraine, and this could only intensify with the potential alliance (and the revival of the “Visegrad” group) between Hungary, Czechia, and Slovakia (Struck, 2025). This alliance raises doubts about the EU’s credibility and capacity to act decisively when its interests are threatened. The grand strategy for the EU is ever-evolving, but its long-term coherence hinges on its ability to overcome internal divisions and maintain that unity as the war in Ukraine rages on. 
    </p>
      <p>
        Faced with the war in Ukraine, the EU has had to reassess its economic strategy, exploring bold political ideas that were previously unthinkable. Whether this is achieved through sanctions or tariffs, diversification of key industries such as energy and industrial production, or through extensive payments to Ukraine, the EU has demonstrated that it can utilize its economic weight as both a weapon and a shield. However, these efforts also demonstrate the limitations of the EU when some member states disagree on grand strategy; the moves become slow or reduced, which highlights the EU's weakness. The EU’s ability to maintain a coherent grand strategy will depend on whether it can sustain the unity it already has and whether it can absorb the economic and political costs of the war.
