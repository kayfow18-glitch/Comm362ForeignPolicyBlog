    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>December 7th</em></p>

    <p>
      I am aware this is incredibly long. I had software running in the background during this video that transcribed the transcript for me, so it didn’t take me too long to get this together. At this point, it’s probably clear I can’t ever do anything halfway.</p>

     </p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>Introduction</strong><p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Kaylin</em></strong>: This is my final blog post for the semester. I will be doing an interview with my friend here, my work colleague that I work with, and I will start with, you know, an introduction for her. And could you briefly introduce yourself and your connection to Ukraine's economic situation? 
    </p>
    
    <p>
       <strong><em>Mariia</em></strong>: Yeah, thank you, Kaylin. My name is Maria Panga. Right now I am a PhD student at George Mason University. I'm doing a PhD in public policy. I'm Ukrainian, [and] before moving to the United States, I received my master's degree in economic analysis at Kyiv School of Economics, and then for five years I have been working for the Ukrainian Central Bank, like think about Fed in the United States at the Financial Stability Department. So I, you know, have both hard textbook knowledge about economics generally, but also about both economic and financial situation in Ukraine since I don't know almost forever and including right now as well, of course. 
    </p>
        </p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>Question 1</strong><p>
      <p>
      <strong><em>Kaylin</em></strong>: Sounds great. I'm going to move into some questions that I have for you. The first one is about Ukraine's macroeconomic trajectory. My question for you is how has the war reshaped Ukraine's long-term economic trajectory and which sectors do you expect will define Ukraine's post-war recovery.
      </p>
        <p>
          <strong><em>Mariia</em></strong>:  Oh, wow, great question. I mean, the impact was and is, you know, horrible, the most devastating that we've experienced since the Second World War. Although we had a few macroeconomic crises before 2022, this is the worst that we've ever experienced.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, just to compare the numbers between 2022, the beginning of the full-scale invasion, and the first invasion of Russia in 2013 with annexation of Crimea, and then 2015 with the beginning of the battlefield war in the eastern regions. For example, in 2015, the GDP dropped around 12%, which was, you know, just a disaster back then. In 2022, GDP dropped by 30%. And the other reason why in 2022 it didn't drop even more is because, you know, after 2015, Ukraine went through some important reforms. So this is why the whole economic and financial sector was more resilient than before in 2014, 2015. As I said, the impact is horrible. Although in 2023 and 2024, we witnessed the economic growth, but you know, basically it happened just because the drop was so huge.
        </p>
          <p>
          And yeah, not because, you know, the war became anything better or didn't have less impact. But, you know, because economy was in such a shock in 2022 So then 2023, 2024, there was just a kind of natural grow from this horrible drop. So in 2023, it grew, I think around 5.56%. In 2024, it was less, it was around 2. 53%. And next year, well, basically this year, I think the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian Central Bank, they expect not more than 3%, but probably is going to be something like 2%. The impact on the sectors was definitely different, but it hit all of the sectors, that's for sure. You know, everything that is related to, for example, you know, power generation, anything that is related to utilities, servicing, it probably was one of the sectors that, you know, was harmed a lot.
        </p>
          <p>
            And just because Russia targeted power generation stations, et cetera, et cetera, it basically affected. It has like an additional effect on all other businesses, you know, obviously for civilians as well, but all other businesses, well, you can just imagine, right, that, um, if you don't have, you know, power, if you don't have electricity at your business, at your office, at your plant, factory, uh, it, it pretty painful. 2022, 2023, it was like a jazzing period when, um, many businesses and different sectors, they, um, you know, started just thinking, so, okay, we're not expecting that it will be getting any better, uh, so what can we do? And this is when, um, businesses started buying like, uh, like small power generators.
        </p>
          <p>
            Power generators, of course, it doesn't work for large, uh, like manufacturers, but there have been a lot of relocation, basically where possible, from Eastern central regions to the Western. Uh, those regions are also under attack on the West, but they're closer to the EU and native border. And there's this expectation that, you know, Russia should be less, you know, less brutal, but actually, unfortunately, it didn't work, um, like that, um, you know, obviously, the sectors that, um, I think were affected not as much were, you know, um, IT, some corporate services, but only because many of those contractors and professionals, they were able to move to some of the EU countries, but they still are working for Ukrainian businesses. Yeah.
        </p>
          <p>
            Uh, but you know, anything else that we can think that is connected to, um, infrastructures has been in a, in a pretty bad form. Uh, there's definitely a growth in, um, military, uh, you know, drones production sector, surprisingly, but, uh, Ukraine, uh, has managed to, has been managing to attract some foreign direct investments that are dedicated specifically for those, uh, military warfare sectors. 
            </p>
          <p>
            Kaylin: Um, yeah, I mean, that was great. That was a wonderful answer. And I guess I just, uh, have a follow-up question to that. Um, kind of looking at Ukraine post-war, um, you know, when the war's over, do you expect Ukraine's economy to become more export diversified, especially with, you know, Ukraine's beginning to get more allies, especially within the EU, within NATO?
