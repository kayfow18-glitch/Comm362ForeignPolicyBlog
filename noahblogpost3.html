    <h2>Strait Up Wrong: Lyle Goldstein Does Not Understand Beijing’s Approach to Taiwan</h2>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>November 2nd</em></p>

    </figure>

    <p>
      	Ever since the inauguration of Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te, a nascent element of Washington’s think tank community has found renewed strength. These authors, including Defense Priorities’ Lyle Goldstein, have taken to arms against the “China Hawks” and have proliferated a number of articles and journal pieces accusing President Lai of undermining cross-Strait diplomacy with his supposedly radical policies. Such authors, however, often have an overwhelming tendency to grossly simplify Taiwan’s domestic politics, parrot Chinese propaganda regarding Taiwan’s military capabilities, and embrace a fatalistic fixed view that seeks to reach a “compromise” that demands Taiwan kneel to Beijing’s maximalist position on its political status. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Take for example Goldstein’s most recent article published in Time Magazine titled “The U.S. Must Beware of Taiwan’s Reckless Leader.” The article, despite only being several paragraphs long, makes several extremely large claims about Lai’s role in the deteriorating cross-Strait relationship. Goldstein’s claims can be summarized into two main portions.
    </p>
 
  </p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>Argument #1: Lai is Moving Towards Independence</strong><p>
      
    <p>
        Goldstein begins his article with an extremely erroneous claim that “Instead of taking a low profile and playing down any claims to Taiwan’s independent status like his more cautious DPP predecessor Tsai Ying-wen, Lai has lurched toward formal independence with a succession of speeches making the case for Taiwanese nationhood.” (Goldstein, 2025). Any novice observer of cross-Strait politics would know this is a terminally unserious argument. Lai’s speeches, ranging from his inauguration to commemoration of 10/10 day, have never seriously broken from the rhetoric of his predecessor. Take for instance, Tsai’s 2023 comments during Taiwan’s national day holiday:
      </p>
        <p>
          “It is my duty as president to safeguard our national sovereignty and the democratic and free way of life of the 23 million people of Taiwan; seeking peaceful coexistence, with free, unrestricted, and unburdened interactions between people across the strait.” (Presidential Office, 2023). 
        </p>
    <p>
      Notably, Lai’s administration has also lacked a serious diplomatic incident such as the 2022 Pelosi trip to Taiwan or the Tsai’s 2023 visit to California. In this area, Lai’s administration has been more reserved, opting for secret closed door talks, sometimes at the behest of the Trump administration. (Hunnicutt, 2025). When Lai has been more bold, it has usually been in response to military exercises conducted by Taiwan, for instance the 2024 Joint Sword-A exercise that was clearly planned to occur before he even gave his inauguration speech. This same trend occurred in October 2024 in the Joint Sword-B exercise, again blamed for Lai’s supposed escalatory rhetoric, despite the fact that commentators noted Lai introduced little new in his speeches. (Dotson, 2024). It is here that Goldstein’s analysis falters: he does not understand that Beijing often makes the decision to escalate far before Lai even chooses what to include in his speeches. Instead, Goldstein is happy to parrot the reasons why Beijing is supposedly upset, such as when he cites PRC state media agency statement released in his own article as supposed evidence that Lai legitimately angered Beijing. (Goldstein, 2025). 
    </p>

   <p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>Argument #2: Taiwan is Incapable of Defending Itself</strong>strong></p>
   
     <p>
    Goldstein’s far more insidious claims come from his assessment of Taiwan’s military strength. He asserts that Taiwan must abandon its strategy of procuring arms from the United States in favor of "asymmetric weapons”, a phrase invoked so often yet lacks any substance beyond “mines.” This also ignores an obvious political element, the fact that arms sales is one of the key ways that Taipei keeps Washington engaged in their relationship, and paves the way for cooperation on things such as asymmetric weapons acquisition. Taiwan, of course, cannot hand-wave massive proliferation of drones and low-cost systems. It is also not helpful that the United States maintains a significant backlog of deliveries, including many asymmetric systems that Taiwan has indeed invested in. (Taiwan Security Monitor, 2025). 
   </p>
    <p>
      	Goldstein continues his comments to decry the lack of expertise in Washington that could inform the President in the event of an emergency. This is, of course, a very fair comment. The comment becomes less serious when he suggests that “Elon Musk, the Trump advisor who was most knowledgeable about China and whose experience with Beijing goes back decades, is now nowhere near the Oval Office.” It is important here to note that Elon Musk has zero military experience, no foreign policy experience, and his “knowledge” of China is constrained to business relations he was hardly exactly directly involved in. Not to mention that these business interests, and the fact he has considerable investments in China, could actively undermine an accurate assessment of how to respond to a contingency in Taiwan. 
     </p>
 
   <p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

    <p>
      	Goldstein’s article is not unique to Washington. In a time where Taiwan’s security woes are more public than ever, every so-called expert wants a piece of the discourse pie. Like many other former Russian experts who have flocked to study China in recent years, they have fallen for the same hype that exaggerated Russian military capabilities, while demanding Washington forfeit its relationship with Ukraine. Much like Russia, Goldstein does not understand Beijing’s motivations towards Taiwan are not shaped by realism, but a historical and personalist drive to conquer and assimilate Taiwan into mainland China.
