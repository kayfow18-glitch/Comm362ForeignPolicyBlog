    <h2>Israeli rockets strike Lebanon despite ceasefire</h2>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>November 16th</em></p>

    </figure>

    <p>
      On Thursday, November 6th, 2025, the Israeli Defense Forces committed various strikes against what it claimed were “Hezbollah targets operating south of the Litani River” (Reuters, 2025). Israel’s justification for the strikes came from military spokesman Nadav Shoshani, who stated Hezbollah was operating south of the river in violation of the ceasefire that ended the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon. As per this ceasefire, Israel agreed to withdraw their forces out of southern Lebanon and Hezbollah agreeing to withdraw north of the aforementioned Litani River. Despite this, as of March 2025, both sides were yet to completely withdraw forces from the assigned regions. 
    </p>
    <p>
      	Last week’s strikes were just the latest in a series of strikes since the November 2024 ceasefire, in addition to Israel maintaining military presence in five areas of southern Lebanon as well. According to Lebanon’s president, Joseph Aoun, these continued strikes have been occurring “on a near-daily basis,” despite Lebanese calls for negotiations since mid-October (A, Jazeera, 2025).  As of the UN’s most recent press release, from October 17th, 2025, regarding ceasefire violations, there have been 108 verified Lebanese civilian casualties, as well as an additional 19 Lebanese abducted by Israeli soldiers. The same report also details how “Israel’s conduct is seriously undermining…effective disarmament” as well as leaving “schools, health centers, and places of worship inaccessible, preventing the resumption of essential civilian life and services” (Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, 2025). Shoshani, in a news briefing, also claimed that Hezbollah were smuggling in weapons and arms from Syria into the Lebanon in an attempt to rebuild its military strength and capability.

    </figure>

      <p>
        	 Aoun also stated that Israel’s continued aggression and violations of the ceasefire are forcing Lebanon into no other choice but to negotiate, but the continued attacks make these negotiations more difficult and disingenuous. After Hezbollah initially withdrew from the villages in the south, Israeli troops moved in and occupied buildings and towns, displacing the local Lebanese families and civilians. The National Council for Scientific Research, Lebanon’s main research and governmental advising organ, has documented almost 500 homes that have been destroyed or demolished by Israeli forces in just three villages, with hundreds more damaged as well (Arraf & Rizkallah, 2025).
      </p>
        <p>
          	In 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon after a Palestinian organization, Abu Nidal Organization, attempted an assassination on the Israeli ambassador to the United Kingdom. The assassination attempt served as the official casus beli and justification for the invasion; however the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) had also been conducting increasingly escalating rocket strike and guerilla warfare against northern Israel from their bases and positions in southern Lebanon, which was one of Israel’s other main causes for the invasion of the south (Hatahet, 2025). After pushing through the south, on June 14 Israeli forces surrounded and begun their siege of the Lebanese capital of Beirut. The siege would end after 70 days after an overall peace deal was reached between Israel and Lebanon, but not until an estimated 4,000-5,000 Lebanese civilians died. 
        </p>
    As part of the agreement, the PLO agreed to withdraw from Lebanon completely, however Israeli forces and troops did not withdraw from southern Lebanon, not withdrawing until 2000. Further harming Israel’s reputation among the Arab world, and the rest of the world as well but to a lesser extent, was when in September of 1982, in the aftermath of the PLO’s overall withdrawal, the Sabra and Shatila massacres occurred. After the power vacuum created by the assassination of then Lebanese president Bashir Gemayel and the Israeli occupation of West Beirut – in violation of the ceasefire, however – both Shatila and Sabra were surrounded by IDF forces that also established both entrance and exit points. As Gemayel was a Christian, the Phalangist militias immediately wanted retaliation for the assassination, and at sunset of Thursday the 16th, the first Phalangist units entered both camps and began massacring the residents indiscriminately. 
      <p>
    <p>
      Not only was Israel’s role just surrounding and restricting entry and exit to the camps but also did not intervene despite having knowledge of what was occurring in the camps (Institute for Palestine Studies & Palestinian Museum, n.d.). For 3 days, the Phalangist militia went through Sabra and Shatila killing all those they came across, including even causing the evacuation of the Akka and Gaza hospitals in Beirut (International Committee of the Red Cross, 1982). After three days, around 300-400 militiamen ended up killing between 1,300 to 3,500 Palestinians and Lebanese Shia, and even the internal Israeli investigation – the Kahan Commission – found that their own personal “failed to take serious steps to stop the killings despite being aware” (Schiff & Ya’ari, 1985).

    </figure>

    <p>
      	In response to Israel’s decision to occupy the south, Hezbollah was created by a group of Muslim clerics in 1982. Israel’s invasion had destroyed a vast number of villages in the south, displacing thousands of Shias further exasperating resentment already building from a historical underrepresentation in Lebanese politics. The group quickly found support from another nation with hostility and resentment towards Israel, with Iran sending 2,000 members of its Revolutionary Guard to train and organize the upstart group (BBC News, 2010). Hezbollah’s main stated goal was resistance to the Israeli occupation of the south, as well as the establishment of a Islamic republic in Lebanon much like its benefactor of Iran. 
      <p>
          <p>  
            	The 1982 invasion was not the last time full blown war broke out between the two, however, with tensions escalating into war after Hezbollah operatives ambushing Israeli forces in a border raid, killing 8 and capturing 2 soldiers. After Hezbollah demanded a prisoner exchange for the soldiers, Israel began military operations with rocket and artillery strikes on both Hezbollah targets and civilian infrastructure, eventually launching a full-scale ground invasion and naval and air blockade. Fighting would last for a month, when the UNSC approved Resolution 1701 unanimously, calling for: disarmament of Hezbollah; Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon; the deployment of the Lebanese Armed Forces and the enlargement of the already present United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) (United Nations Security Council, 2006).

    <p>
      Hezbollah head, Naim Qassem, said in a statement in a televised speech that “they remained committed to the [2024] ceasefire and that there was ‘no alternative’ to that deal.” Qassem went on, however, to explain that Hezbollah could not stop rejecting full disarmament while Israel’s strikes continue to occur and how “there is a limit to everything” (Reuters, 2025). The strikes came just after Israel reportedly pressed Lebanon to “be more aggressive in disarming” Hezbollah, which the Lebanese government rejected any notion of, fearing it would “ignite civil strike and a derail a disarmament plan seen as…effective” and confident the army can “declare the south free of Hezbollah arms by 2025” (Gebeily & Lubell, 2025). 
          </p>
  <p>
    	In a UNIFIL report from November 14th of this year, a geospatial survey conducted by the forces found that Israel created a “concrete T-wall” that after analysis crossed the Blue Line. This wall cut off approximately 4,000 square meters of Lebanese territory, further adding suspicion and speculation about the possibility of another Israeli invasion of Lebanon (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, 2025). Despite being informed of the violation, Israel has not moved the wall and even was stated as saying the wall “is part of a broader plan whose construction began in 2022” (Al Jazeera, 2025, November 14). These recent round of strikes also come two months after the UNSC voted to extend UNIFIL’s mission to December 2026, however after that the almost 11,000 personal would begin withdrawing from Lebanon after pressure from the United States on behalf of Israel. President Salem voiced his support for the vote but added how he still “reiterates the call for Israel to withdraw its forces,” and a UNIFIL spokesperson questioning how Resolution 1701 could be fully implemented while Israeli troops still remained in the south: “The commitment of the Lebanese government is there, but how can they be deployed everywhere in the south if the [Israeli military] are still present in the south?” (Al Jazeera, 2025, August 28).
