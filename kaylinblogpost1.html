    <p>
      On September 9th, when European Commission President Ursula von Der Leyen gave her State of the Union address to the European Parliament, she made a bold claim about the Israeli-Palestine conflict. Von der Leyen said boldly of Gaza: “And I know that for many citizens, Europe's inability to agree on a common way forward is equally painful. They are asking how much worse things must get before there is a unity of response. I understand. Because what is happening in Gaza is unacceptable,” (European Commission, 2025), the acknowledgement of this issue from the European Union’s top official definitely meant changes were coming regarding EU policy towards Israel. The EU, according to Von der Leyen, “...[Europe] must lead the way - just as it has done before” (European Commission, 2025). In this admission, Von der Leyen acknowledges that this new foreign policy towards Israel will require the EU to walk alone. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The EU is no stranger to radical policies that require bold initiatives. The EU Green New Deal (European Commission, 2025) and the EU’s policy towards refugees (European Commission, 2025) are among the most progressive policies in the world, demonstrating that it can take such bold steps. Yet, this decision to finally punish Israel for its war crimes (UN Human Rights Report in Gaza, 2025) in Gaza comes too late. The EU’s failure to act decisively on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has caused way more harm than good. The decision now to levy tariffs and stop some trade with Israel is a positive step forward for the EU, but it is too little too late.

    </figure>

    <p>
      The European Commission, whilst the highest body with executive political power in the EU, does not have legislative authority to enact laws. Instead, they must submit proposals to the Council of the European Union, which then negotiates with the European Parliament to adopt EU legislation (Council of the European Union, 2025). Given that this subject is controversial, the European Commission is taking a roundabout way to get this legislation passed. Instead of passing a true EU law, which requires approval from the European Parliament, the European Commission is requesting a Resolution, changing how it can be passed (European Commission, 2025). 
The Council of the European Union will vote to pass this resolution without the European Parliament’s input. They will need 15 out of 27 Member States to agree, and those Member States must have a total population that is 65% or more of the EU’s total population, which is the qualified majority rule  (Council of the European Union, 2025). If the Council of the European Union approves this resolution, it will take effect 30 days after its approval. While this seems reasonable in theory, this goal is quite the uphill battle. It remains unclear whether the EU will reach the required numbers for this resolution to pass. Regardless, the proposed tariffs and trade sanctions do not go far enough, even if the resolution is passed.

    </figure>

    <p>
      This entire resolution stems from the notion that Israel violated Article 2 of the EU’s human dignity values (European Parliament, 2025). The European Commission is claiming that Israel has seriously breached the agreement of this article, and their response must be proportionate in value. Unsurprisingly, the EU does not plan to ban trade with Israel entirely. According to the European Commission, the EU imported goods from Israel in 2024 worth 15.9 billion Euros (European Commission, 2025). Additionally, the EU is Israel’s biggest trading partner, given the proximity to the supranational institution. However, the tariffs that the EU wants to place on Israel do not cover 60% of Israeli exports (de la Baume, Euronews, 2025). Roughly, only 37% of Israeli exports will be tariffed. A top EU Commission official said: “[Tariffs] wouldn't include provisions on capital movements, as when you trade, you also need to make sure that money can flow,” because the EU has said they do not want to “punish” Israel (de la Baume, Euronews, 2025).
It is essential to recognize that the EU’s shift away from staunch support for Israel is significant. Martin Konečný, who heads a European Middle East Project think tank in Brussels, said: “The European Commission and Israel’s deep allies like Von der Leyen are now willing to use serious economic sticks…” showing that this move is quite unprecedented (de la Baume, Euronews, 2025). Yet, this move was never going to be enough. These tariffs present themselves as a way for the EU to claim they care about what is happening in Gaza while still not truly punishing Israel. If the EU cares so much about human rights as they say they do, then its public policy must be even harsher towards Israel.

    </figure>

    <p>
      By relying on, in essence, symbolic tariffs to be levied on Israel, the EU risks undermining its credibility as a global defender of human rights. The Treaty on the European Union outlines the criteria for Member States to join and defend “free and fair trade, eradication of poverty and the protection of human rights,” demonstrating that the EU prioritizes the operation of its Member States within this category (Treaty on the European Union, 2012). It does not make any sense that the EU should not afford this dignity of human rights to countries it deals with. These symbolic tariffs do not actually threaten or pressure Israel. In fact, they might even embolden them to act more harshly to see what they could actually get away with. This half measure means that the EU is losing its credibility as a pillar of an organization that cares about human rights. If the EU wants to get serious about leveraging its power, it must consider harsher, more concrete punishments for Israel. A starting step for this new public policy towards Israel would be suspending the EU-Israel Association Agreement, which would strip Israel of all of its valuable trade benefits with the EU (European Union-Israel Trade Agreement, 2025). This would send a clear message to Israel that human rights violations have economic consequences.
Furthermore, the EU must impose an arms embargo on Israel. In 2023, Germany supplied 30% of arms to Israel, meaning that the EU supplies about 1/3rd of Israel’s arms supplies (de la Baume, Euronews, 2025). An arms embargo would prevent European Union technology from committing war crimes and align with the idea that it supports all forms of human rights. These steps, taken together, would transform the EU’s current public policy from complacency to meaningful action.
