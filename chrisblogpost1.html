    <h2>An Article Response to Aid for Ukraine</h2>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>September 28th, 2025</em></p>

    <p>
      U.S. aid to Ukraine has been an ongoing debate for years now and remains as one of the most pressing foreign policy issues in the last decade. The article I analyzed focused on the USAID and their role in providing financial support and civilian assistance to Ukraine, and how funds have been cut after the trump administration took office. The article highlights Ukraine’s urgent need for money to defend against Russia’s invasion as well as the billions the US sent to Ukraine to ensure that Ukraine can hold their own. However, the article did not show the full story and did not tell us the other side of the story from an unbiased conservative point of view of the issue. 
      According to a story published by FOX News, a republican news outlet, USAID is extremely important in preventing the expanding power of the Chinese Communist Party and the Russian government. A former ambassador for the Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), James Gilmore urged Trump to repurpose funds back to Ukraine to ensure victory. Gilmore describes the refunding as an investment for international strategy and says it is a “pivot to the future.”  The other FOX News piece was about the USAID cuts and Trump’s reasoning for cutting back on the funding. After the oval office meeting with President Zelenskyy, Trump cuts the USAID funding because of the Ukrainian President’s lack of progress towards facilitating peace talks with Russia. The article also states that Zelenskyy is not doing enough to get funding from European governments as well. While the primary article talks about funding as accountability and supporting Ukraine, FOX News frames the funding as demanding appreciation and peace and Europe paying its fair share. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has forced Ukraine to rely heavily on international support to keep Russia at bay, which includes funding for munitions. The support that Ukraine has received from the US has supported their ability to continue fighting but to also keep the government functioning during wartime. Civilian aid programs are the critical force that aids with times like this that contributes to rebuilding structures, providing food, and providing housing for citizens. Budget support directly from another government ensures that Ukraine can still hold their own in the heat of war and that Ukraine's facilities do not collapse because of the war. Without this external support, Ukraine would surely weaken, and resistance would be softer than ever. However, funding would need to be closely and properly monitored because they can easily be manipulated by corruption and diversion. 
      The US has already supported Ukraine immensely. USAID managed to fund over $30 billion to the Ukrainian government and even gave a $20 billion loan to Kyiv alone. Since the beginning of President Trump’s second term, the assistance structure the United States had has shifted significantly. In three months, 25 civilian aid programs were ultimately terminated and 29 were transferred to the state department. Several others paused. Several aid monitoring contracts that were supposed to track aid were also disrupted, regardless of their role in making sure that accountability was ensured. These changes were ultimately these changes demonstrated how critical the US is in assisting Ukraines survival and why oversight and management is necessary when sending large amounts of money.

    <p>
      The article had a gap that did not address the bigger picture of the debate whether the US should provide support to Ukraine. The article did not mention what that support should cover whether it was for humanitarian support, munitions, or military. There are multiple ways we can fill this gap. For example, the US should strengthen Ukraine’s with military aid. Diplomatic engagement such as sanctions on Russia, and coordination with other governments could create more conditions and opportunities for peaceful resolution. Additionally humanitarian assistance would alleviate suffering among civilians. These approaches all carry different goals that would help Ukraine in their fight, and they address urgent needs without slowing down the fight. Furthermore, diplomacy requires that nations cooperate and find common ground in international interest and security. Leaving this gap is not ideal when we are trying to solve the issue at hand. The article missed the important question, not whether the United States should support Ukraine or not but how can the United States provide sustainable assistance and how they can use their influence to gain allies to ensure the security of not only Ukraine but the rest of the world. 
    </p>
        <p>
       Another consideration is that the support the United States provides to Ukraine should be balanced with other nations, particular those in Europe. Countries in Europe have a direct interest in helping Ukraine, since Russia’s invasion threatens their own security. The United States has provided far more assistance than Ukraine’s own allies which is raising some concerns about sustainability and fairness. This also raises questions: how much should other countries be expected to contribute and how much is enough for the United States to consider how much assistance is enough? Trump has expressed that neighboring nations in Europe should shoulder much of the financial burden especially since Ukraine is bordering those countries.
              </p>    
        </p>
    This would give security that Ukraine is able to still fight their fight but also give the United States security that they do not need to assist Ukraine alone. The article talking about US aid to Ukraine made the point that USAID is important funding for Ukraine to function and fight their fight against Russia. It showed how billions of dollars in support kept Ukraine running and taking an approach explaining how the Trump administration disrupted funding management and shifted programs to the state department. It failed to explain why the cuts happened in the first place and ignored the broader and more important aspect of the debate, which is whether the US should be providing support and what kind of support we should provide. Right winged sources such as FOX News provide this missing context, tying these cuts to Ukraine's lack of progress to initiate peace talks and the need for Europe to carry more of the burden. They also present that the aid is integral relies heavily on to prevent the expansion of Russia and the CCP. My response shows that Ukraine heavily relies on the US and their support to fight against Russia, however funding requires monitoring to prevent corruption. Most importantly, the bigger picture is not just whether the US should provide support or not but how that support should look in general and how much European allies should contribute.
