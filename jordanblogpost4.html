    <h2>Israel is Committing Genocide in Gaza</h2>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>December 7th 2nd</em></p>

    <p>
      	The United Nations Genocide Convention defines genocide as the “intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group” by way of committing any of the following against the group(s): “killing; causing serious bodily or mental harm; deliberately inflicting…conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births; forcibly transferring children…to another group” (United Nations, 1948, art. II). The next article expands that not only will genocide be punishable, but “conspiracy to commit genocide; dire and public incitement to commit genocide; attempt to commit genocide; complicity in genocide” (United Nations, 1948, art. III). After entering into force in January of 1952, 153 states have become party to the treaty as of February of this year, with only one signature, the Dominican Republic, not ratifying it, and forty-four that have yet to sign or ratify at all. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Crimes against humanity, are “acts committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, such as: murder; extermination; deportation or forcible transfer of population; torture; rape…or any other form of sexual violence; the crime of apartheid; other inhumane acts…causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health” (Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, 2018, “Crimes Against Humanity” section). What differentiates genocide from crimes against humanity is “proven intent…to physically destroy a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group,” with genocide victims being “deliberately, not randomly, targeted because of their real or perceived membership in one of the four protected groups” (Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, 2018, “Genocide” section). Genocide and crimes against humanity can happen at any time, both in and out of armed conflicts, whereas war crimes can only occur during armed conflicts and wars.

    </p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>Killing Members of the Group:</strong><p>
      <p>
        Since the Israeli invasion of Gaza in response to the October 7th, 2023, attacks, 60,199 Palestinians have been killed – at least as of July 2025 when the UN report was published – among them 18,430 children and 9,735 women (Independent International Commission of Inquiry, 2025). Additionally, life expectancy in the strip before October 2023 was 75.5 years, but after the first twelve months of the war, this dropped a staggering 34.9 years to a life expectancy of 40.5 years. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) found that between 18 March and 9 April, Israeli forces conducted 224 “strikes on residential buildings and tents for displaced people,” 36 of which – all corroborated by the UN Human Rights Office (UNHRO) – the fatalities were compromised of “only women and children” (Independent International Commission of Inquiry, 2025). According to internal Israeli intelligence figures, 8,900 Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad members have been killed or are presumed dead as of a May 2025 report. At the same time of this report, it is estimated that a total 53,000 Palestinians had died in Gaza, which when taking the Israeli intelligence figure into an account, 83% of those killed up to that point were civilians.  
      </p>
        <p>
          The Gaza Strip is populated by an estimated 2-2.4 million people tightly packed into an area of 365 square kilometers, making it one of the most densely populated areas in the world, with 5,479-6,575 people per square kilometer. It is because of this extreme density that the Israeli military’s use of “heavy unguided munitions…focused on what causes maximum damage” – according to an Israeli security official – is the first evidence piece that Israel is guilty of genocide (Independent International Commission of Inquiry, 2025). The “relentless” use of air-dropped munitions (bombs) is the first problematic strategy, as US intelligence estimates that between the start of the conflict and December 2023 Israeli forces dropped “at least 29,000 explosive munitions” (Young, 2023). In addition to the frequency of the bombs, the intensity of the bombs also drew scrutiny, as an estimated 90% of bombs dropped carried payloads of between 1,000-2,000 pounds. The sheer quantity and quality of these munitions are not the only problem, as US intelligence again found that 40-45% of bombs were ‘dumb,’ as in they are unguided as opposed to ‘smart’ bombs that allow more guidance and are therefore more accurate. The use of ‘dumb’ bombs in highly and densely populated areas can needlessly kill additional civilians, as well as wreaking havoc on civilian infrastructure and buildings (Young, 2023). Israel, according to one military export, “dropping in less than a week what the United States was dropping in Afghanistan in a year,” with Israeli ground forces only needing an estimated 10 minutes “ground forces to collect intelligence to identify a target and to strike it” (Young, 2023 & Rathbone, 2023).  
        </p>
     </p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>Causing Serious Physical/Mental Harm:</strong><p>

    <p>
      	As of July 2025, it is estimated that Israeli security and military forces/operations has injured 146,269 people (Independent International Commission of Inquiry, 2025). Israeli forces have also been found to have causes severe mental harm to Palestinians, especially Palestinian children and detainee. Those detained by Israeli forces were subjected to “torture, rape and other forms of sexual violence and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment” that was found to have resulted in serious physical/mental harm. According to the Human Rights Watch (HRW), some detainees are forcibly stripped (sometimes fully), photographed and filmed fully or partially nude, with the images being published by Israeli soldiers and distributed by the media and activists (Human Rights Watch, 2024). B’Tselem, an Israel nonprofit who document and publish “reports on human rights violations committed by Israel in the Occupied Territories” – as per their website – also found that “violence is an ever-present part of daily life” of Palestinians detained by Israel and in Israeli prisons and facilities (B’Tselem, 2024). Detainees were also subjected to acts of sexual violence by guards and soldiers such as: “metal tools and batons to cause genital pain; penises being grabbed; gang sexual violence and assault committed by group[s] of prison guards or soldiers” (B’Tselem, 2024). Physical abuse would often come from “pepper spray, stun grenades, sticks, wooden clubs, metal batons, gun butts/barrels, brass knuckles and tasers,” resulting in “severe injuries, loss of consciousness, broken bones” (B’Tselem, 2024). 
    </p>
    	Israeli bombings and operations have also caused severe environmental damage to Gaza, with the “water, sanitation, and hygiene systems [becoming] almost entirely defunct,” and severe damage to the solid waste management system (United Nations Environment Programme, 2024). Additionally, the almost 39 million tonnes of debris caused by the war pose serious environmental threats because of – according to the same 2024 UNEP report – “dust, unexploded ordnance, asbestos, industrial and medical waste, and other hazardous substances,” as well as lead and other heavy metals leaking from destroyed solar panels potentially contaminating soil and water.

    </figure>

  </p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>Deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about physical destruction:</strong><p>
    <p>
      	As of a World Health Organization (WHO) report from May 2025, Israel “continue[s] to threaten an already weakened health system…at [its] breaking point,” in a clear attempt to restrict Palestinians access to health care and medical services, a war crime and key part of the genocide argument (World Health Organization, 2025). In the same report, the WHO goes on to detail how during the week before the report alone, there have been “28 attacks on health care,” with 697 attacks since the start of the conflict (World Health Organization, 2025). Of Gaza’s 36 hospitals, only 19 remain operational, with 12 providing “a variety of health services” and the remaining 7 only operating “basic emergency care” (World Health Organization, 2025). North Gaza has been rendered effectively uncovered by nearly all forms of health care, with Al-Awda Hospital only remaining minimally functional, only serving as a “trauma stabilization point.” It is estimated that across the entire strip, only 2,000 beds remain available, with at least 40 at risk of being lost within evacuation zones, with an additional 850 under threat if conditions worsen in the zones. 
      <p>
          <p>  
            	Hospitals and healthcare facilities are not the only parts in danger, as health workers and ambulances are also being targeted in the strip. In one incident, “at least 15 Palestinian medics and rescue workers…were shot dead after Israeli forces opened fire on their vehicles,” with the vehicles later being bulldozed and burned (Amnesty International, 2025). Among the dead was eight Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) workers, six members of the Palestinian Civil Defense, and UNRWA staff member, with one PRCS worker remaining missing, presumably captured by Israeli forces. From the start of the conflict to a NIH report published in September 2024, “at least 595 healthcare workers had been killed…2.5% of Gaza’s healthcare workers” at the time (Khanji et al., 2025). Additionally, as of 7 May 2025, there have been 686 recorded health attacks on 122 health facilities and 180 ambulances, including the complete destruction of the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital and damage to sections of Nasser, Al-Durrah, and Al-Ahli Arab hospitals after the resumption of hostilities on 18 March 2025 (OHCA, 2025).

    </p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>Countering genocide denial arguments:</strong><p>
    <p>
      	The first common argument against Israel’s actions is that their war is only against Hamas and is “not seeking to destroy the Palestinian people or the Palestinian population of Gaza” (AJC, 2025). Israel’s use of unguided dumb bombs, intentional targeting of the healthcare infrastructure, and the disproportionate amount of civilian casualties, mainly women and children, show that the war is not “just against Hamas.” 
          </p>
  <p>
    The second argument is that “Israel is responding to Hamas’s actions on October 7th” and is well within its legal right to do so (AJC, 2025). International Humanitarian Law (IHL) is the set of principles and standards that guide global wars and conflicts, and is made up of three key principles: necessity “permits measures which are actually necessary to accomplish a legitimate military purpose and are not otherwise prohibited by international humanitarian law”; proportionality “prohibits attacks against military objectives which are ‘expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated”; and distinction where parties must “at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives and accordingly shall direct their operations only against military objectives” (International Committee of the Red Cross, n.d.). When it comes to the Israel’s right to self-defense, it does have the right to defend itself after being attacked, however a key part of this right codified in the UN definition is “Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council,” which Israel did not do (United Nations, 1945). Israel also fails to adhere to the proportionality standard by showing a lack of regard for civilian life and civilian casualties, as shown by the numerous facts above. Israel’s intentional targeting of hospitals and use of unguided bombs in densely populated areas shows their lack of distinction between civilians and Hamas fighters.
