    <h2>Analyzing CNN’s Expert Foreign Policy Panel Debate</h2>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>September 28th, 2025</em></p>

    </p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>Is America’s “War on Drugs” Really About Regime Change?</strong></p>
    <p>
      In a recent CNN expert panel discussion titled “Is This About Drugs or Regime Change? Trump’s Military Moves in Latin America” posted in its entirety by one of the panelist members Bakari Sellers on YouTube, analysts debated whether the Trump administration’s new military operations in the Caribbean were truly aimed at fighting drug trafficking or if they signaled a different strategy of regime change in Latin America. This comes after the Trump administration said the US military blew up four suspected drug smuggling boats, killing 14 people. The conversation raises many fundamental questions about how the United States defines its foreign policy goals and the legitimacy of its military interventions. While the official narrative emphasizes national security and narcotics control, many of the experts on the panel suggest the real motives may be political and strategic. This challenges the line between fighting crime and pursuing power.
    <p> 

    </p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>The Official “War on Drugs” Narrative</strong></p>
    <p>
      The debate begins with the debate moderator, Abby Phillip, giving some background using clips of the administration’s justification for its actions of a renewed war on drugs. Two of the clips show President Donald Trump and United States Secretary of War Pete Hegseth making jokes about blowing up the boats near Venezuela. Initially, there was this framing by the moderator that fits a pattern familiar in American politics, using the “war on drugs” as the Trump administration's rallying cry to justify intensifying the military presence abroad. Panelist Julia Loffe quickly dismisses the phrase by sarcastically saying, “I'm just surprised nobody has tried a war on drugs before”. She then changes topic to talking about Ice quotas and the destruction of the White House’s East Wing to bring forward the point that it is all theater for the president to eventually stay in office indefinitely. 
          </p>
        <p>
      Then, panelist Lydia Moynihan counters this by saying the reason the Trump administration is using for justification is that the country of Venezuela is a foreign terrorist organization. By labeling drug traffickers as terrorists, the administration elevates what has historically been a criminal justice issue into a domain of international conflict. Yet, as the panelists note, the sheer scale of the operation appears disproportionate to the challenge of intercepting small smuggling boats. The mismatch between the stated purpose and the resources deployed sets the groundwork for the main question of the discussion, which is, if not drugs, then what was the reason for the strikes? It was made clear by the moderator at the beginning that there is a concern for transparency, as it is reported that many Pentagon officials require non-disclosure agreements to prevent leaks. This is why the panel members are now left to fill in the gaps with what they think the motivation may be. One of those gaps that eventually comes up is whether or not this is about Venezuela’s oil.
    </p>
    
</p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>The Regime Change Theory</strong></p>
    <p>
     As the conversation progresses, the debate turns into an even more controversial theory. Panelist member Betsey McCaughey takes on an emotionally led approach to her debate as she brings light to how the nation is suffering from all of the drugs being brought into the country illegally, which kills a hundred thousand Americans a year. Ana Kasparian interjects to add that the administration just wants a regime change in Venezuela and that these “anti-drug” missions are, in fact, a cover for efforts to destabilize the Venezuelan government. She asks all the panelists, “Why are we pretending like this is about drugs?” So, Betsy made her stance known that it is, in fact, about drugs, and Americans support the stance on a war against drugs. The U.S. has a long history of framing regime change operations as humanitarian or security missions. The panel’s critics of the Trump administration argue that the “war on drugs” may be the latest iteration of that narrative. One that allows Washington to pursue geopolitical goals under the banner of public safety.
      <p>

  </p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>The Legality of Strikes</strong></p>
    <p>
      A central thread throughout the debate involves the legality of these operations. Bakari Sellers questions whether the U.S. government has the authority to target suspected traffickers using lethal force, especially in international waters or near foreign territories. One of the strongest moments in the debate was when Bakari brought up how the strikes are illegal. Two of the panelists disagreed with him, but he countered each of their points effectively. When Lydia told him that drone strikes have been widely used without congressional authorization since 2011, Bakari stands on the fact that it still doesn’t make it legal. Lydia then uses the tactic known as whataboutism, where she notes Obama and Biden have done the same thing. Despite Bakari being liberal leaning, he still stands on the fact that it is illegal and was wrong for previous presidents to have done the same without approval. There are also questions about whether the individuals targeted are terrorists or just fishermen because the survivors were let go to their country without being questioned.
    </p>

  </p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>Conclusion: The Narrative about U.S. Foreign Policy</strong></p>
    <p>
      The CNN panel’s debate exposes a recurring issue in American foreign policy. Officially, the Caribbean mission was an extension of the war on drugs, but some believe it effectively served as a tool for regime pressure and projecting power. This discussion highlights the risks of using adaptable narratives to justify military actions. When security language conceals political goals, it leads to confusion internationally and distrust domestically. To maintain global leadership and moral authority, the U.S. must ensure its actions align with its declared principles. Labeling a regime-change operation as a drug war might bring quick political gains, but it damages long-term credibility. The CNN debate reminds us that words carry significance, and honesty behind them is crucial.
