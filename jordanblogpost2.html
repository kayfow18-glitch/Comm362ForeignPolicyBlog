    <h2>Current Event News Video</h2>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>November 2nd, 2025</em></p>

    <p>
      Good morning, I am Jordan Giles and I will be your host for tonight’s news broadcast. It was just announced this weekend that President Donald Trump will be sending the USS Gerald R Ford to the Caribbean. The Ford’s deployment comes with President Trump’s consideration of the use of military force to target “cocaine facilities and drug trafficking routes inside Venezuela.” Even more recently, US forces carried out another strike against a boat allegedly trafficking drugs for the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua on October 24th. This marks the 10th boat that the administration has publicly disclosed striking since the first attack on September 2nd. The strikes have resulted in the death of at least 43 people, all of whom the administration claim to have been drug smugglers and gang members. The administration, as per the National Defense Authorization Act, notified Congress of at least the initial strike in September, calling the targeted individuals “unlawful combatants.”   
  </p> 
    <p>
      VIDEO CLIP 1 (42 seconds): The USS Gerald R Ford can be seen conducting multiple high-speed turns and maneuvers during testing and training phases prior to its first deployment. The Ford is considered by many experts to be one of the most advanced and dangerous carriers in the US Navy, possibly even the world.

          The use of the term “unlawful combatants” echoes the Bush administration’s use of the term to describe, strike, and detain terrorist members and networks in the wake of 9/11 after Congress authorized the use of military force against terrorist organizations. However, Congress has not authorized the use of military force to target drug cartels and organizations, raising questions of the legality of the strikes. After a classified briefing of the House Armed Services Committee, Democrats were reportedly “not satisfied with the answers they received” and were also “unclear on both its legality and the administration’s ‘end game’.” According to Colorado Democrat Jason Crow, he “walk[ed] away without an understanding of how and why they’re making an assessment that the use of lethal force is adequate” after administration lawyers cancelled their planned explanation of their legal rationale last minute. Republican representative and chair of the committee Mike Rogers, along with the ranking member and Washington Democrat Adan Smith, declined to comment on the details of the meeting. Democrats were not the only members of Congress that seemed to be confused and wanted more transparency from the administration, as Republican Senator from South Carolina, Lindsay Graham, said “there should be a briefing of the Congress on what’s going on.” Members of the Senate Armed Services Committee have had equally as bad luck; with Republican chair Roger Wicker and ranking Democrat Jack Reed late last week publicly disclosing two letters they sent to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth requesting information and transparency.

      The Ford is the flagship of Carrier Strike Group 12, often called “the Navy’s most advanced aircraft carrier strike group.” The Ford was commissioned in 2017 as the first of its class successor for the Nimitz-class carriers, and despite being the largest ship ever put to sea by the Navy, has approximately 20% smaller crew size than its predecessors because of the upgraded efficiency of systems. According to the Navy, the Ford’s two nuclear reactors produce more than three times the amount of electrical power than the reactors on the Nimitz-class. The increased power output allows the Ford the ability to not only launch heavier and more fueled aircraft at a faster rate, but also move munitions across the ship faster as well. Not only is the ship itself improved, but the Ford also carries F/A-18 fighter jets, which can engage in air-to-air, ground, and ship combat as well as being able to execute bombing operations with laser guided bomb systems. The Ford also carries several aircraft dedicated to jamming electronics, as well as airborne early warning and control planes that can act as command centers in the air. 
      </p>
    <p>
      VIDEO CLIP 3: (31 seconds): Several McDonell Douglas F/A-18 fighters and a Grumman E-2 Hawkeye being recorded while undergoing flight operations practice such as landings and takeoffs. The F/A-18 is one of the most advanced and superior fighter jets in the US military’s arsenal, and is one of the best in the world as well. The E-2 Hawkeye is the Navy’s top airborne early warning and control aircraft, and can serve as an airborne mobile command center.

      In addition to the Ford, an estimated 4,500 Marines and sailors, and even an amphibious assault ship, multiple cruisers, destroyers, and amphibious transport docks – along with a large number of accompanying aircraft and helicopters – have been allocated to be sent to the Caribbean. The ships and troops, coming from the Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group and the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit, prior to being moved, had been reassigned to US Southern Command which is the regional command that Venezuela is under. What the Ford lacks, however, is experience, as its first deployment was only 3 years ago in 2022, with its first combat deployment coming a year later in 2023 when it spent time in the Mediterranean after the Hamas October 7th attacks in Israel.  
      </p>
    When asked, Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro indicated that he knew exactly what the US was doing, stating: “They promised they would never again get involved in a war, and they are fabricating a war.” The Trump administration states that their goal is to end the influx of drugs coming from Venezuela, and reportedly one of the ways they plan to achieve that is to remove Maduro from power.  
    <p>
      VIDEO CLIP 4 (33 seconds): Maduro talking about how the US is fabricating a war against Venezuela by conducting the strikes in a speech given to the nation on the state-owned broadcast channel last Saturday, October 25th.

      According to several officials within the administration familiar with the policies, there has already been a secret list of specific targets drawn up ready to be executed upon the president’s orders. This, in combination with the buildup of US military forces in the region, has made Trump’s intentions unclear. Karoline Leavitt, press secretary for the White House, told the press earlier this week that Trump was going to make his decision “within two weeks.” The idea of military involvement in Venezuela, however, is massively unpopular among the American people, with 62% of survey respondents strongly or somewhat opposing a military invasion of Venezuela, and only 16% strongly or somewhat supporting it. American interference is also unpopular within Venezuela itself, and so is the idea of war coming to an already struggling nation and people. Sharyn Alfonsi conducted street interviews in the nation’s capital Caracas for a 60 Minutes segment on life on the ground of Maduro’s Venezuela, where all those interviewed denied the nation was a narco-state and emphasized the importance of the nation’s right to sovereignty and self-determination.

    <p>
      As of now, the situation in Venezeula and the Carribean is exrtremely tense. The uncertainty of the Trump administrations next action and plan going forward is still the biggest question, and whether or not the strikes will turn into a full scale invasion and war remains to be seen. That’s our segment for tonight, good luck and good night to all watching.
