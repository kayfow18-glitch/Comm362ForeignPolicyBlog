    <h2>The “Double Tap” Controversy: Hegseth, an Admiral, and the Deadly Strike That Has Us Asking Hard Questions</h2>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>December 7th</em></p>

    <figure style="max-width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;">
      <img src="images/" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 6px;">
      <figcaption style="font-size: 0.85rem; color: #555; font-style: italic; margin-top: 6px;">placeholder text</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      The Pentagon is reeling after revelations that U.S. forces fired twice on a single Venezuelan vessel in the Caribbean this year. There was an initial strike and a follow-up strike that hit survivors clinging to the wreckage. The second attack killed at least two people who had survived the first strike and raised questions about the legal basis for what happened, calls for transparency, and allegations that U.S. leaders may have crossed a line that could amount to war crimes. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended the use of maritime strikes against suspected narco-trafficking boats as part of a larger effort to protect Americans and to disrupt transnational criminal organizations. But reporting in The Washington Post alleged Hegseth issued a verbal order during the incident. He has phrased it bluntly in some accounts as “kill everybody” aboard the vessel (Horton, 2025). Those accounts, and the footage many lawmakers have viewed, have driven bipartisan outrage, leading to questions about who authorized the follow-up strike. Targeting people who are out of the fight in combat could violate the laws of armed conflict and amount to a war crime.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Adding to the drama is the role of Navy leadership in the immediate political fallout. The White House and Pentagon have publicly sought to pin operational responsibility on Adm. Frank M. Bradley, the naval commander who the administration says “directed the engagement,” which is a move that could shield Hegseth from accountability. Democrats and some former military leaders say the pivot looks like throwing a subordinate under the bus. An especially fraught development given the potential legal exposure U.S. service members face and the long-term implications for command trust (De Guzman, 2025). Supporters of Hegseth and the administration insist the strikes are lawful, necessary, and targeted at criminal networks that imperil the United States. 
    </p>

      <p>
        That defense raises a more fundamental question: what is the true goal of these strikes? Are they a “war on drugs” operation, or do they serve as a step toward regime change by undermining Venezuela's maritime lifelines? The strikes might align with broader U.S. pressure on the Venezuelan government and its allied criminal groups. They could also be how the administration frames the operations as counternarcotics actions, and stressing links between Venezuelan criminal networks and designated terrorist groups to justify cross-border force. This ambiguity is important because it influences legal authorizations, congressional oversight responsibilities, and international reactions. The factual record about fentanyl and other synthetic opioids complicates this narrative. Analyses from U.S. agencies and independent researchers show that global fentanyl production and supply are primarily based outside Venezuela, mainly in Mexico. Government assessments and experts warn that Venezuela is more of a transit point for trafficking rather than a main source of fentanyl heading to U.S. streets. The difference between where strikes occur and where fentanyl actually originates raises questions about whether the stated aim is proportionate or if the real goal is something different (U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, 2020). 
      </p>
        <p>
          Democratic lawmakers are demanding more transparency, while some Republicans defend the strikes as necessary to stop a deadly drug flow. The debate now involves both the effectiveness of these strikes and their legality, along with their impact on U.S. global reputation. Questions about whether the White House’s statement, which Admiral Bradley directed the operation, and Hegseth distances himself, are bureaucratic or ethical. If a secretary orders lethal force that a subordinate carries out, who is ultimately responsible? And how should democratic accountability be maintained? The implications include military morale, civil-military relations, and whether U.S. troops are seen as operating under rules or political motives. Protecting senior political appointees at the expense of military commanders could set a dangerous precedent (Politico, 2025). 
        </p>
    
    <p>
      As pressure grows, the norms of transparency and oversight established during the Biden era and post-2020 are being tested. Lawmakers are considering hearings and subpoenas, human rights advocates are calling for international referrals, and legal experts say the U.S. must examine whether its actions comply with treaties and its own war laws. Currently, footage and the fate of two survivors of a strike, who died in a follow-up attack, fuel a huge moral and legal debate.
