    <h2>Kinmen: The Spark that Could Light the Taiwan Strait on Fire</h2>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>September 28th, 2025</em></p>

    <figure style="max-width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;">

    <p>
      This cycle of slow escalation around Kinmen has gone under covered. While heaps of articles, think tank pieces, and op-eds have rightly covered the recent incidents around Scarborough Shoal as an example of how minor maritime disputes have the capacity to escalate to major conflict, Kinmen remains the most likely flashpoint for a conflict to erupt. This is due to the PRC’s monopoly on escalation, something that will lower the cost of escalation and make intervening actions from the United States or Taiwan exceedingly difficult in the event of a crisis. <p><strong>Where We Stand Now</strong></p>
      In the months following last year’s incident, China has dramatically escalated its coordinated harassment campaign around the Kinmen islands. What was once a semi-monthly cruise in the area outside Kinmen’s restricted waters has become three- to four-day-long intrusions by multiple vessels. Taiwan, for its part, has taken a note from the Philippines in its response, attempting to provide transparency by publishing information on the scale and timing of the intrusions as they occur. This strategy, dubbed “assertive transparency” by South China Sea researchers, attempts to raise the costs of grey-zone activity by exposing it to a wider audience, bringing consequences to the aggressor nation. (Powell & Goirigolzarri, 2023). 
        However, this strategy has several limitations. Most importantly, it requires a wide audience capable of mobilizing support for punishment. Kinmen is not Scarborough, and it does not attract the same level of militant attention from political leadership as Scarborough does in Manila. In Taipei, Kinmen’s defense is not a serious political issue, and attention to grey-zone activity is firmly fixated on the PLA’s activity around Taiwan’s core territory. Additionally, China cares very little about international condemnation regarding its activity around Taiwan, as it views it as a core province and a purely internal affair. (Reuters, 2025) 
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
  Here, it is important to bring up another critical barrier to serious action in defense of Kinmen: it is logistically and materially unlikely to succeed. Kinmen is mere miles from mainland China, within range of several modernized brigades of the PLA. There is reason to believe China could conquer Kinmen without military force, as it holds substantial leverage over critical infrastructure, including power and water. (Murphy, 2024) Within this context, China holds a strong set of cards to play, heightening the risk of swift action to force a fait accompli in Washington and Taipei.
</p>

<p class="fake-header left-align"><strong>Future Risk Forecasting</strong></p>

<p>
  In the near term, China is likely to continue to escalate its campaign around Kinmen, further encroaching on Taiwan’s sovereignty and seeking to stoke fear and pressure in Taipei regarding the status of the islands. While it could conduct, and likely succeed in, kinetic action around Kinmen for decades, Beijing has opted for a slow campaign of pressure to achieve its aims. Central to this strategy is the use of the China Coast Guard, who act under the shield of legality to conduct intimidation campaigns targeting Taiwan’s economic interests around Kinmen.

</figure>
    
    <p>
      However, there is a secondary impact when this conduct goes undeterred. It signals that Taipei is incapable of defending Kinmen, which emboldens Beijing to expand its campaign to Taiwan’s core territories, including Formosa and the Penghu islands. Beijing is well aware of this and seeks to expand grey-zone aggression to provoke defeatism in Taiwan’s public, encouraging it to seek unification. Ultimately, Kinmen’s untenable position makes the cost of escalation low, while the price of intervention is far too high. Strategies to defeat China’s grey zone campaigns will require inter-ally cooperation and bold risk-tolerant action; the alternative is letting Kinmen sink into the PRC’s grasp until it’s too late to stop it.
