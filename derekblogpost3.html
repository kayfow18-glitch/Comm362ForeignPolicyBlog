    <h2>A Foreign Policy Critique of U.S.–Mexico Immigration and Deportation</h2>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>November 16th</em></p>

    </p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
    <p>
      The relationship between the United States and Mexico has long been shaped by immigration and deportation policy. For many in Mexico, U.S. immigration policy is a foreign-policy concern that deeply affects Mexico’s economy, social structure, and security. The mass deportations of migrants from the U.S., which include non-Mexicans, raise serious human rights, economic, and diplomatic concerns. The smuggling of U.S. firearms into Mexico fuels cartel violence and undermines state stability. These dynamics highlight the need for cooperative solutions to address the shared challenges.
    </p>
    </p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>Deportations:Human Rights and Economic Pressures</strong><p>
   
      <p>
      Since the beginning of President Donald Trump’s 2025 term, Mexico has received tens of thousands of deportees from the United States. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said nearly 39,000 individuals were deported to Mexico, with about 33,000 of them being Mexican nationals. The remainder of the people deported to Mexico were from other countries, accepted “for humanitarian reasons.” (Reuters, 2025). This policy of accepting non-Mexican deportees has drawn a lot of criticism from Mexican civil society. The growing deportation burden comes at a time of budgetary strain for Mexico’s immigration institutions. According to Mexican government sources, budget cuts have left the National Migration Institute and related agencies under-resourced, which severely limits their capacity to absorb and include large numbers of deportees (The Straits Times, 2024). This lack of infrastructure risks creating a humanitarian crisis in Mexican border cities, as deported individuals may lack shelter, access to legal assistance, or economic opportunities.
    </p>
      <p>
      Mexican critics argue that the U.S. is outsourcing its deportation burden without fully ensuring the safety or dignity of returned migrants. As The Guardian reports, local Mexican agencies are warning that they lack a coherent strategy to manage mass deportations, particularly of non-Mexican asylum seekers, some of whom face extreme risks if sent back (The Guardian, 2025). The U.S. has reportedly asked to land military flights to deport migrants directly into Mexico. This is a request that Mexico has refused (Asharq Al-Awsat, 2025). Mexico is being drawn into U.S. immigration enforcement without equal power in the negotiation and faces mounting social costs. Deportation is being used as a geopolitical tool by the U.S., and Mexico is paying the price.
      </p>
    
    </p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>Cross-Border Firearms: Security and Sovereignty</strong><p>
      
    <p>
      The Mexican government argues that a significant portion of the weapons used by criminal organizations comes from the United States. For example, in a formal case before the U.S. Supreme Court, Mexico contends that as many as 90% of crime guns recovered in Mexico can be traced back to the United States. The then-President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said that during his administration, Mexican authorities seized 50,000 “high-power” firearms, roughly 75% of which he claimed came from the United States (CBS News, n.d.). The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) reports show a very large number of trafficking cases where Mexico is the target country. This reinforces Mexico’s argument that U.S. gun trafficking into its territory is a major policy and security concern. Mexico has turned to legal action to address this. In 2021, the Mexican government filed a suit against several U.S. firearms manufacturers, some of them including Smith & Wesson, Beretta, and Glock, accusing them of being complicit in arms trafficking to Mexican cartels (Zapata, 2025). This is a good legal strategy, and it is also a good foreign policy move, which is aimed at pressuring U.S. companies and the government to take responsibility for the bloodshed in Mexico.

</p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>Power Imbalances and Ethical Responsibility</strong><p>
 
</p>
    The relationship between the US and Mexico is very complex and imbalanced, specifically regarding immigration and deportations. Mexico faces challenges absorbing deported migrants, including non-Mexicans, without sufficient support. This raises concerns about human rights and Mexico's international reputation. Mexico criticizes the US for externalizing enforcement costs and contributing to insecurity through firearms trafficking. The US is estimated to be the source of 70-90% of trafficked guns in Mexico, which is fueling violence in the region. This imbalance is straining their relationship and destabilizing the border region, which neither country wants. To address the many issues with immigration, there needs to be more cooperation with the United States. This could include cost-sharing for shelters and integration programs, and cooperation on firearm tracing and intelligence sharing. Mexico can also press for corporate accountability and work with human rights bodies to protect deported individuals. Right now, Mexico is pushing for change to get the US to share the responsibility and work together more effectively.
