    <h2>A “Jettenson” to the Center: What’s Next for the Netherlands and its Foreign Policy?</h2>

    <p>
    The Netherlands has always been a small country with a substantial diplomatic footprint: pro-European, pro-market, and often unexpectedly setting the tone for European Union (EU) coalitions in Brussels. The October 29, 2025, parliamentary election appears to have given that mantle the second wind it requires to sail on. After two years of tumultuous politics, in which the far-right Partij voor de Vrijheid (Party for Freedom, PVV) won remarkably under Geert Wilders, that short-lived government experiment has now come to an end (Bego, 2025). Dutch voters have handed a striking rebound victory to the centre-left, to the Democraten 66 (Democrats 66, D66) and its charismatic young leader, Rob Jetten (Meijer, et al., 2025). The miraculous rebound of centre politics opens the chance for the Netherlands to reclaim a stabilizing, values-driven voice in European foreign policy, something it has lacked in the past two years due to political instability. This idea hinges on whether policymakers in The Hague and Brussels view it as an opportunity, rather than a definite outcome.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This recovery to the center significantly matters for three reasons. First, the Netherlands is a policy agenda setter within the EU; it is a vital trading nation that sets precedent for ensuring other member states are aware of the EU's agenda on most policy areas (Government of the Netherlands, 2025). Secondly, the Dutch political system, which supports the rule of law, means that any decision made in The Hague directly reverberates through EU policy rooms in Brussels (Government of the Netherlands, 2025). Third, the stakes of this election are uncharacteristically high: Europe is at the forefront of dealing with an invigorated Russia; a transatlantic partnership that is constantly in flux and continually rebuilding itself; and a growing sense of intercontinental populist ideology that seeks to capitalize on leftist incumbent discontent (Beznosiuk, 2025; Bergmann, 2025; Cliffe et al., 2025). A confident, headstrong, center-liberal Dutch government posture would strengthen multilateralism in The Hague and in Brussels. At a time when the best answer is unknown, a powerful actor for EU action would provide stability in a time of uncertainty. 
    </p>

    </figure>

      <p>
    However, the importance of this moment depends on what is actually translated into tangible policy. D66 and Jetten ran on a well-balanced mix of changing the status quo around domestic goods (the housing crisis in particular and education) and a pro-European Union, liberal internationalist stance (Verhelst, 2025,[Dutch Debate]; Cokelaere & Verhelst, 2025; Kirby & Holligan, 2025). The surge of the centre-left showed that voters were becoming impatient with the government, or lack thereof, under Wilders, and that the far-right experiment in the Netherlands was over; Dutch voters sought functional problem-solving over making their politics a spectacle for the world to watch. 
      </p>
        <p>
        D66’s and Jetten’s ascendance to becoming the new Dutch Prime Minister is no mere fluke, but presents a unique challenge forthcoming. Placing Jetten in this situation places a pro-EU actor at the center of what will become a complex coalition-building issue.
        </p>
    

    <p>
      Building this D-66 coalition will not be easy, but Jetten is confident that he will be able to put together a government (van den Berg et al., 2025). D66 has stated that if they were to emerge victorious in these elections, they would attempt to form a broad coalition, true to their party's principles (Meijer, 2025). Based on current results, this coalition would have a majority in the Dutch Parliament, but it would be fragile. The Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie (People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, VVD) has stated multiple times that it would never work with the GroenLinks–PvdA (GreenLeft–Labour, GL/PvdA) due to disputes over tax policy (Meijer, 2025). Both of these parties, which are predicted to have 22 and 20 seats, respectively, would have to work together for Jetten’s potential broad coalition to succeed.
    </p>
    The last party needed for this coalition to have a majority is the Christen-Democratisch Appèl (Christian Democratic Appeal, CDA), with 18 seats. This party shares similar values with the D66, so it is most likely that the CDA and the D66 have no broader problems forming a coalition, at least among the two parties. There are other coalition possibilities, such as a centre-right coalition, but Jetten has said that this is not his first choice, and it would also be unstable. Given the complexity and uncertainty of what the Dutch government could look like, it will most likely take months for a coalition to form. However, any parties that decide to join a D66-led coalition will determine whether Jetten’s voice is loud in Brussels or simply constrained to domestic politics in The Hague. 
      <p>
    <p>
      Even if such a coalition forms, Dutch foreign policy does not unfold just within the confines of The Hague and other domestic institutions. The Netherlands operates within a supranational EU decision-making system, where key issues such as foreign policy, trade, and security are mostly decided at the EU level (Government of the Netherlands, 2025). The European Council, the European Commission, and the European Parliament primarily make these decisions. Within these institutions, The Hague can articulate its national policy preferences. Their policies are more likely to become law and succeed if they are aligned with broader EU coalitions that exist among member-states with like-minded policy ideas. This return to the center for the Netherlands is significant because it no longer ostracizes itself at the supranational level. This rebound is not merely a domestic corrective imperative, but the start of meaningful coalition-building within the EU. These coalitions will provide any forthcoming Dutch foreign policy with leverage within this institutional framework and ensure it has a real impact.
     </p>
      
    
    <figure class="img-right">

      <figcaption>placeholder texts</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      As these coalition talks progress from domestic priorities to foreign policy decisions, one, and arguably the most important and immediate test, will be the Netherlands’ policy posture towards Ukraine. Brussels and the EU as a whole will be closely watching how the Netherlands moves. A Competent EU state like the Netherlands will often serve as a leader in policy coalitions in Brussels, and early Dutch decisions on policy towards Ukraine will signal whether The Hague intends to resume its role as a reliable partner for Zelenskyy and Ukraine (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, 2025). Any D66-led coalition will thereby shape how quickly the Netherlands can translate this electoral momentum into more solid support for Ukraine.
      <p>
          <p>  
            A hypothetical coalition of D66/VVD/PvdA-GreenLeft/and CDA would need to work together to bridge a consensus on policy towards Ukraine. Jetten has said that Europe must work to defeat Putin and that the Netherlands will stand with Ukraine (Wax, 2025). The D66 is likely to push for more support and aid for Ukraine, a sentiment that already resonates deeply within Brussels. VVD leader, Dilan Yeşilgöz-Zegerius, met with Zelenskyy in March of this year to discuss how the Netherlands can continue supporting Ukraine (President of Ukraine, 2025). These discussions included the procurement of more weapons to Ukraine, like F-16s and drones. This kind of support for Ukraine aligns with what the VVD is likely to prioritize for Ukraine: cost-effective and visibly beneficial measures rather than open-ended funding promises.
             </p>
    <p>
      The PvdA-GreenLeft would be D66’s most critical ally in leveraging more support for Ukraine. Again, in March of 2025, the party made a joint statement calling for EU countries to pool their defense investments for Ukraine and to deliver additional support (European Greens, 2025). Any aid that would go to Ukraine would most likely have to come with human rights safeguards, along with some sort of climate provision, for the PvdA-GreenLeft to agree to send aid. There is uncertainty about the future of this party alliance, however, because the party's leader, Frans Timmermans, resigned on election night. A potential successor candidate for this role is Jesse Klaver, who has reaffirmed his willingness to work with the D66 multiple times. The CDA would likely provide no pushback against D66's policy for Ukraine, as they want to continue supporting Ukraine and investing in its defense (Hilgeman, 2025). Together, a D66/VVD/PvdA/Greenleft-CDA coalition would forge a practical Ukraine foreign policy package that would have visible impacts. Forming this policy package would be tedious, but it is crucial to maintain the Netherlands' legitimacy as a key actor in Brussels regarding Ukraine.
      </p>

    <p>
      However, expectations of success must be tempered. While the centre did emerge victorious in these most recent elections, it does not mean the far-right is shut out of discussions. Wilders’ PVV party is still projected to have 26 seats in the new Dutch parliament; however, that number is down from 37. Wilders has begrudgingly supported Ukraine, primarily because public sentiment in Europe is generally favorable towards Ukraine. However, Wilders has been incredibly defensive on sending aid to Ukraine, something he blocked earlier this year. The Netherlands pledged to send Ukraine €3.5 billion in support aid in 2026, but this plan was blocked entirely by Wilders and his party (DutchNews, 2025). 
          </p>
  <p>
     Wilders has also been incredibly critical of refugees in the country, specifically Ukrainian men (De Ruiter, 2025). He has suggested that Ukrainian men ought to be deported back to their country so that they can fight for their country. This hardline stance is what led to the collapse of the previous Dutch government, as Wilders undermined the last coalition because the parties could not agree on a migration policy.
    </p>
      <p>
        A new challenge for this Dutch government will be reconciling itself with the rise of the Juiste Antwoord (Right Answer 2021, JA21), which went from 1 seat to 9 seats in these new election results. Led by Joost Eerdmans, JA21 tends to take a neutral side on Ukraine but is hesitant to support it heavily (Nijhuis et al., 2025). Another factor is the, albeit small but important, rise of Forum voor Democratie (Forum for Democracy, FvD), which went from 3 to 7 seats in this most recent election. Under the guidance of Lidewij de Vos, FvD is incredibly hardline on Ukraine and mostly sympathizes with Russia (Nijhuis et al., 2025). They want to portray that this war is primarily the EU’s fault, given its support for so-called “color revolutions” that happened after the fall of the USSR. These parties, taken together on the right, although they do not have one concrete policy towards Ukraine, create a policy environment that will be hostile towards any positive Ukrainian policy.
      </p>

    <p>
   When examining these actors, it becomes apparent that Dutch policy towards Ukraine will ultimately depend on how successful a centrist coalition can be. If the center parties (D66, VVD, PvdA-GreenLeft, and CDA) can maintain some form of cohesion, they can translate this electoral comeback and rebound into actual supranational EU-level influence that creates meaningful policy in Brussels. This hinges on whether the far-right (PVV, JA21, and FvD) stays fragmented, but if they do not, they could become a prominent veto voice in what will be a fragile Dutch government. This outcome would stall the Netherlands, rendering it an unknown actor in EU foreign policy towards Ukraine once again. Whether this moment is merely a brief corrective, Dutch foreign policy will ultimately be determined by whether the center can withstand far-right pressure, something it demonstrated in its parliamentary elections in October.
