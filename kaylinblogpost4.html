    <p>
      I am aware this is incredibly long. I had script running in the background during this video that transcribed the transcript for me, so it didn’t take me too long to get this together. At this point, it’s probably clear I can’t ever do anything halfway.</p>

     </p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>Introduction</strong><p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Kaylin</em></strong>: This is my final blog post for the semester. I will be doing an interview with my friend here, my work colleague that I work with, and I will start with, you know, an introduction for her. And could you briefly introduce yourself and your connection to Ukraine's economic situation? 
    </p>
    
    <p>
       <strong><em>Mariia</em></strong>: Yeah, thank you, Kaylin. My name is Maria Panga. Right now I am a PhD student at George Mason University. I'm doing a PhD in public policy. I'm Ukrainian, [and] before moving to the United States, I received my master's degree in economic analysis at Kyiv School of Economics, and then for five years I have been working for the Ukrainian Central Bank, like think about Fed in the United States at the Financial Stability Department. So I, you know, have both hard textbook knowledge about economics generally, but also about both economic and financial situation in Ukraine since I don't know almost forever and including right now as well, of course. 
    </p>
        </p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>Question 1 & Discussion</strong><p>
      <p>
      <strong><em>Kaylin</em></strong>: Sounds great. I'm going to move into some questions that I have for you. The first one is about Ukraine's macroeconomic trajectory. My question for you is how has the war reshaped Ukraine's long-term economic trajectory and which sectors do you expect will define Ukraine's post-war recovery.
      </p>
        <p>
          <strong><em>Mariia</em></strong>:  Oh, wow, great question. I mean, the impact was and is, you know, horrible, the most devastating that we've experienced since the Second World War. Although we had a few macroeconomic crises before 2022, this is the worst that we've ever experienced.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, just to compare the numbers between 2022, the beginning of the full-scale invasion, and the first invasion of Russia in 2013 with annexation of Crimea, and then 2015 with the beginning of the battlefield war in the eastern regions. For example, in 2015, the GDP dropped around 12%, which was, you know, just a disaster back then. In 2022, GDP dropped by 30%. And the other reason why in 2022 it didn't drop even more is because, you know, after 2015, Ukraine went through some important reforms. So this is why the whole economic and financial sector was more resilient than before in 2014, 2015. As I said, the impact is horrible. Although in 2023 and 2024, we witnessed the economic growth, but you know, basically it happened just because the drop was so huge.
        </p>
          <p>
          And yeah, not because, you know, the war became anything better or didn't have less impact. But, you know, because economy was in such a shock in 2022 So then 2023, 2024, there was just a kind of natural grow from this horrible drop. So in 2023, it grew, I think around 5.56%. In 2024, it was less, it was around 2. 53%. And next year, well, basically this year, I think the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian Central Bank, they expect not more than 3%, but probably is going to be something like 2%. The impact on the sectors was definitely different, but it hit all of the sectors, that's for sure. You know, everything that is related to, for example, you know, power generation, anything that is related to utilities, servicing, it probably was one of the sectors that, you know, was harmed a lot.
        </p>
          <p>
            And just because Russia targeted power generation stations, et cetera, et cetera, it basically affected. It has like an additional effect on all other businesses, you know, obviously for civilians as well, but all other businesses, well, you can just imagine, right, that, um, if you don't have, you know, power, if you don't have electricity at your business, at your office, at your plant, factory, uh, it, it pretty painful. 2022, 2023, it was like a jazzing period when, um, many businesses and different sectors, they, um, you know, started just thinking, so, okay, we're not expecting that it will be getting any better, uh, so what can we do? And this is when, um, businesses started buying like, uh, like small power generators.
        </p>
          <p>
            Power generators, of course, it doesn't work for large, uh, like manufacturers, but there have been a lot of relocation, basically where possible, from Eastern central regions to the Western. Uh, those regions are also under attack on the West, but they're closer to the EU and native border. And there's this expectation that, you know, Russia should be less, you know, less brutal, but actually, unfortunately, it didn't work, um, like that, um, you know, obviously, the sectors that, um, I think were affected not as much were, you know, um, IT, some corporate services, but only because many of those contractors and professionals, they were able to move to some of the EU countries, but they still are working for Ukrainian businesses. Yeah.
        </p>
          <p>
            Uh, but you know, anything else that we can think that is connected to, um, infrastructures has been in a, in a pretty bad form. Uh, there's definitely a growth in, um, military, uh, you know, drones production sector, surprisingly, but, uh, Ukraine, uh, has managed to, has been managing to attract some foreign direct investments that are dedicated specifically for those, uh, military warfare sectors. 
            </p>
          <p>
            <strong><em>Kaylin</em></strong>: Um, yeah, I mean, that was great. That was a wonderful answer. And I guess I just, uh, have a follow-up question to that. Um, kind of looking at Ukraine post-war, um, you know, when the war's over, do you expect Ukraine's economy to become more export diversified, especially with, you know, Ukraine's beginning to get more allies, especially within the EU, within NATO as they become closer to them, or do you expect them to be sort of more dependent on those few key sectors that have started to, um, gain some traction, um, before and during the war?
            </p>
          <p>
            <strong><em>Mariia</em></strong>: Uh, so, so Ukraine is the, one of the largest agri-products, agriculture sector exporters Uh, Ukraine has been also exporting a lot of, um, let's say iron ore, everything related to metal, metallurgic sector. Um, if we're talking about agriculture sector, um, we are still exporting, uh, we definitely export less, uh, I mean, we as Ukraine, and, um, we, Ukraine has been trading with the EU, NATO countries, you know, since, since the collapse of Soviet Union, um, it's, um, it was getting better after Ukraine signed, um, the, um, association, it's like association agreement with the EU, and I think Ukraine is an EU candidate right now, but the path is, you know, completely ambiguous at this point So Ukraine, before 2022, I think Ukraine has done a lot of homework in terms of, if we're talking about agriculture, food processing sector.
        </p>
                <p>
                  Ukraine has done a lot of work on packaging, you know, following and being compliant with all of the EU regulations. Yep. So, um, Ukraine has been exporting everything that Ukraine exported before 2022 to the EU countries, but definitely the amount of products being exported is less. We have been also supplying a lot of agricultural items to basically one of the poorest countries in Asia and Africa. And right now Ukraine struggles with just collecting the grain. So actually, those countries, I don't even know whether they were able to substitute because Ukraine used to sell it cheaper than other countries. So if we're talking about agriculture and food processing industry, I think once the fields are demined and the problems with power generation are resolved, I think that we will just go back to the previous figures of exporting those items. And the second part of your question?
        </p>
                      <p>
                        <strong><em>Kaylin</em></strong>: Will Ukraine sort of depend on those few key sectors like agriculture, or will they become more export diversified? Will Ukraine look to other types of exports to generate GDP? 
        </p>
                      <p>
                    <strong><em>Mariia</em></strong>: You know, it's a tricky question because we still don't know. I mean, if we're talking about ideal peace agreement for Ukraine, you know, basically going to the state of, you know, 2021 and, you know, maybe to the borders of 1991, hopefully, then we'll just go back to our, you know, pretty diversified export portfolio where we'll go back to exporting mining industry outputs, metallurgy. I mean, food processing and agriculture should just, I don't know, maybe become even larger in terms of like revenue for Ukraine and also values.
                      </p>
          <p> 
            So, I mean, I'm not expecting that any of those sectors will, you know, significantly skyrocket because, you know, we have obviously, you know, some certain amount of the crop that we can have, we cannot like jump over that, how it was before. I think that something that might actually grow up significantly, it's military and warfare production sector. And not only in terms of, you know, like specific, I don't know, drones, but also expert of R&D, basically. And, you know, there's also a lot of talking about Ukraine's minerals, right; they are essential for electronics and warfare as well. So, maybe this is going to be another sector in terms of export that will arise. The trade with, you know, Russia and some other post-Soviet countries that, you know, clearly joined Russia in this war against Ukraine.
        </p>
              <p>
                I don't see how it will be recovering because basically since 2015, we, 2014, 2015, we stopped any trade and we were not affected in those terms of exporting. So, I think that the, you know, Asia, Africa, and the EU countries, I think it will still be our main trade partners.
              </p>
          <strong><em>Kaylin</em></strong>: That's a great, you know, way to close that. I think, like you said, it is idealistic. We have to assume that, you know, a peace plan is going to be in place that doesn't harm Ukraine. And it's kind of hard to project, you know, where the economy is going to go because we don't really know what the end of the war is going to look like.
           <p>

    </p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>Question 2 & Discussion</strong><p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Kaylin</em></strong>: And kind of moving into my next question, it's about physical stability and aid dependence for Ukraine. Ukraine's budget is heavily supported by foreign assistance, primarily through their neighbors in Europe. The US has become a little bit more wishy-washy with the Trump administration. But I want to ask, from an economist's perspective, what does a sustainable balance between domestic revenue generation for Ukraine and foreign aid look like during and after the war, assuming we have a peace plan that is beneficial and right for Ukraine? 
    </p>
    <strong><em>Mariia</em></strong>: Okay, okay. Yeah, that's a good point to answer because we can think about so many things. Well, it's, you know, it's a good and it's very complicated question in terms of Ukraine's budget. And, well, we're basically talking about revenue generated from Ukrainian taxpayers. You know, Ukraine has been raising its tax base in Ukraine since 2022, something that, you know, is happening whenever a war, a country is in, you know, a full-scale war like Ukraine is right now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, the IMF and EU assistance were a huge, huge help. I mean, you know, very significant assistance because Ukraine in this position when, you know, it needs not only defend Ukraine, defend itself, defend Ukraine. And even during the war, Ukraine still has been, you know, restoring or building some, you know, residential buildings, power generating facilities, bridges, you know, anything that you can think about infrastructure because, yeah, it might be damaged again, but you don't have any other choice. You cannot just leave it where it is. So, Ukraine has to do all of that, but also Ukraine has to keep managing, you know, its social welfare function. And in those terms, of course, it was, you know, it was pretty significant.
     </p>
      <p>
        Just the idea of imagining Ukraine dealing with this by itself without, no, I'm not even talking about, you know, military help with weapons, but without any financial support, well, it will be pretty tough because, you know, we still have, you know, a pretty big, even a pretty big budget sector, government sector that, you know, still needs to be working. So, if we're talking about what is happening right now, you know, this is what me and my colleagues as part of advocacy efforts for Ukraine here in DC, we're always talking that, you know, it's, we're very grateful, but it's never enough. It never has been enough. So, so far, you know, it's so hard to just look at Ukraine's budget, how hard it is actually to manage the revenues and expenses, and you know, always, yeah, just, you know, they don't have any other choice, the government relying on, you know, either grants or loans.
    </p>
          <p>
            It's always part of the Ukrainian budget since 2022. Of course, you know, grants are so much better than loans. And again, Ukraine is, you know, is in a desperate position. So, we don't have any other choice, but even accepting, you know, those loans that are, you know, pretty, pretty costly in terms of interest rate. But so far, our partners, Ukraine's partners were, you know, very understanding in terms of, you know, going through changing, you know, interest rate or maturity of the loan in terms of, like, paying back the loan and the interest. So, it's been pretty tough. If we're talking about the future and, you know, the ideal plan for Ukraine and, you know, the very important part of this is, you know, Russia paying for the damag
    </p>
              <p>
          If this is part of the peace deal, which I think, you know, has to be. It must be because otherwise it just doesn't have any sense. I think that definitely, and we're talking about, right, at least $300 billion At least, it should be more because the damage exceeds so far twice, I don't know, three times what the damage is, and obviously we cannot even evaluate all the lives that were lost, you know, all the, I don't know, people that are alive but have been traumatized so much by, you know, any type of, you know, every type of war crimes that Russia committed to Ukrainians I think in that case the reliance on EU and the US will be going down, but going down only in terms of, you know, grants and loans, because Ukraine expects to have a lot of projects for reconstruction and rebuilding, where other countries, and specifically, you know, those countries that supported Ukraine, not those countries that were, you know, just actively killing
    </p>
      <p>
        Ukrainians, or those countries that were just like, you know, saying that they're neutral, but those countries that were actively supporting Ukraine. I think that they will have, you know, a lot of business interest in investing in Ukraine and having reconstruction and rebuilding projects and ultimately preparing for long-term cooperation. I think, you know, if all of that is actually happening, I think Ukraine will be able to, you know, repay everything and growing, you know, in terms of GDP, unemployment, you know, should go down for sure.           
    </p>
       <p>
         <strong><em>Kaylin</em></strong>: The kind of total economic situation, financial situation, I think it should be improving. Yeah, and on that last point about, you know, there's potential investment opportunities for the EU, I know that recently, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has floated the idea of forming an anti-Ukraine bloc with Slovakia and the Czech Republic, with Fico and Babiš. And so when you get those three no votes in the EU, it becomes very hard for the EU to support Ukraine. What risk do you see if donor support from the EU is stymied because of opposition in the EU? 
          <p>
           <strong><em>Mariia</em></strong>: Yeah, well, just going back a little bit, you know, when I said about the, you know, future investment projects, I think it will not be only the EU. I think, you know, we're talking about the United States as well; we're talking about countries like, oh God, I wanted to say North Korea, South Korea, and Japan, for example, those who have been, you know, pretty much supporting Ukraine in humanitarian aid, you know, different types of aid. And, you know, basically, countries around the world who are supporting Ukraine, not trying to, you know, damage Ukraine more. In terms of this anti-Ukrainian bloc, I think that, you know, Czech Republic, like Orban put there. Czech Republic, I think it will not happen, because Czech Republic anyway was pretty supportive. 
    </p>
                <p>
               <strong><em>Kaylin</em></strong>: Yeah, that's what I've also done some research on, they have been, but their incoming Prime Minister has sort of floated the idea. He is a populist. He has met with Orban a couple of times and he wants to revitalize the Visegrad group. So his whole point is he wants to, you know, get those countries together. And this is something that has been, you know, on the table, it's not set in stone. Do I think it'll happen? Probably not. Because like you said, the Czech Republic is sort of, you know, they have supported Ukraine, but it is a possibility So that's why I was just curious, because obviously the EU is on Ukraine's doorstep. They are the EU, or Ukraine is a candidate member state for the EU, so they do get a lot of support from them. And if, you know, that support is even more stifling. Poland was also initially, right? But obviously Poland.
    </p>
                      <p>
                  <strong><em>Mariia</em></strong>: Yeah, Poland's no, yeah, Poland's, yeah, yeah. Well, the president of the Czech Republic, Fiala, he is very supportive of Ukraine. If we're talking about those two other EU countries, and especially Orbán, because he was the major anti-Ukrainian power there, so far the EU somehow was able to overcome those obstacles. I think as long as the EU might have, let's say in the future, some reconstruction projects in the EU, and maybe at that time Orbán will not be in power, because we don't kno
    </p>
       <p>
         <strong><em>Kaylin</em></strong>: They have elections next spring, so that is true. And what I've heard about Hungarians who, for different reasons, come here, they all say sorry and they're embarrassed about everything that is going on there.
    </p>
             <p>
               <strong><em>Mariia</em></strong>: I think for Orbán, as long as Russia will be defeated, because again, this is the ideal peace plan that we're talking about right now, I think that it will change, even if he is still in power. Because I don't think that there is a huge support from the Hungarian population. 
             </p>
      <p>
         <strong><em>Kaylin</em></strong>: Yeah, I would agree with that. I think it's mainly at a federal government level for Hungary. Orbán, I mean, he's Putin's puppet, so he's got to do all of this stuff at the EU level. But from what I understand, public sentiment, Hungarians are very supportive of Ukraine because they do know that if Russia ever tried to expand, that they could be on the list. So it is their due diligence to support Ukraine, so I think that is a good perspective on that as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><em>Mariia</em></strong>: Yeah, but again, there are so many moving parts, as you know, and sometimes it's not even clear in terms of Orbán. Sorry for elaborating on that, but it's not even clear if he will be more listening to Russia or the United States, because it looks like he has a very high hope and expectations in terms of Hungarian and the US cooperation. Although it's a little bit funny because Hungary itself is not part of the EU, it's this small open economy, and the US economy is just gigantic, so Hungary will benefit. The US probably will not even feel it, so I think it also depends on what signal will be coming from the United States, from the administration in the future. Yeah, that was a great conversation about that question.
      </p> 
                  
       </p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>Question 3 & Discussion</strong><p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Kaylin</em></strong>: Yeah, that was a great conversation about that question. I think you kind of touched on this a little bit, but I did want to ask, I think you, like I said, you did mention it, but what conditions need to be in place politically, institutionally, militarily for international investors to view Ukraine as a viable space for post-war reconstruction? 
    </p>
         <p>  
          <strong><em>Mariia</em></strong>: That's a good question. I feel like inside Ukraine's anti-corruption movement, civil society, this is something that people have been discussing probably since 1991, 1992. Obviously, right now, especially those who are very vocal regarding stopping any assistance for Ukraine, Ukraine has some issues with corruption, as I always add it, as anywhere in the world, but we're talking about Ukraine specifically here. The past months showed that Ukraine has a pretty strong civil society and a very low tolerance for suppressing anti-corruption.
          </p>
      <p>
        Ukrainian civil society has a very low tolerance for suppressing anti-corruption institutions and independent media, which usually is a big part of anti-corruption efforts in any country. What has been revealed so far is that Ukraine has problems with corruption. Ukraine also has pretty strong anti-corruption institutions and civil society. I think that... You know, civil society, anti-corruption institutions, supplemented by the additional supervision, let's say, from the IMF, because they also care, you know, very much. Obviously, the supervision from all of Ukraine's allies in terms of, you know, how money and how resources were spent. I think this is something that will be, will have a positive dynamic. People are, you know, sick and tired of hearing about those corruption scandals, but I think it's even more suspicious when we don't hear about anything like that.
      </p>
         <p>
           So first condition is, you know, being country with a, you know, zero tolerance to corruption, ensuring that, you know, if we're talking about, let's say, public procurements, and Ukraine, you know, did a significant progress since 2015, everything is digitalized right now. So Ukraine completely cut the, you know, those loopholes for collusion, you know, collision, and basically corruption. So Ukraine's priority is to go and be sure that investors, foreign investors, they, you know, will not have to deal with any of that. I think there's definitely some work is going on right now. So the second point is the harmonization of the legislative legislation base, with the, primarily with the EU as a candidate to the EU. And again, if it's fully harmonized with the EU, then I think it will be more understanding and transparent for the US and all other partners around the world.
       </p>
             <p>
               So I think this is the second, the second kind of element of providing this, you know, good space for both private and government foreign investors. I would say just if we're, you know, doing like top three, I think that the third could be the Ukrainian banking sector and, you know, everything regarding payment processing, payment systems, you know, FinTech. Ukraine, you know, to be honest, when I moved to the US, I was surprised that if you want to, you know, move money from one account to the other account, you have to wait. Because in Ukraine, it's like, you know, it's like it takes seconds to do. And Ukraine went to, you know, electronic money, digital money, pretty strongly, you know, since 2015.
       </p>
                 <p>
                   We had this whole concept that, again, when you don't operate with cash, you know, it's just easier to, you know, to see corruption or some gray area that is going on. So I think this is the third element. And Ukraine has been doing very well in that one. Ukrainian banking sector is pretty resilient, obviously harmed by the full-scale Russian invasion as well. But I think there will be more corporate lending inside Ukraine. And this will, you know, those domestic sources and cheaper loans will be attractive for investors as well. 
       </p>
                     <p>
                <strong><em>Kaylin</em></strong>: Yeah, I mean, I think that's incredibly important. And it kind of leads into my next question, like a follow-up to that is, you know, assume all three of your categories, they all get met in this idealistic world. Are there reconstruction sectors where you foresee the fastest growth of capital versus the slowest? Where does Ukraine make immediate impact? Where might it lag behind? 
       </p>
         <p>
            <strong><em>Mariia</em></strong>: Yeah, so I think that Ukraine will be attracting more foreign capital, but also some of the large Ukrainian businesses. And I'm talking about, you know, those who went on IPO to Warsaw Stock Exchange or London Stock Exchange. We have some large companies, primarily in agriculture, mining, and food processing business that are not only, you know, present on those foreign stock exchanges, but they also were so good that they were attracting foreign capital abroad. And, you know, with really good terms of those either loans or Euro bonds abroad, they, I think even now, actually, they don't have a lot of troubles with attracting financing.
       </p>
             <p>
               In terms of foreign capital, right, coming in. Yeah, I think it's basically one of the rebuilding reconstruction plans of Ukraine. We're expecting that Ukraine expects that the interest of, you know, governments, but also private companies like big businesses, should be pretty high in terms of moving capital to Ukraine and investing in those reconstruction rebuilding projects. Ukraine's regulation prior to 2021, in terms of, you know, free movement of capital, it was pretty liberal. When a country is in a state of war, you have to, you know, put some certain limits for capital withdrawal, but Ukraine wasn't definitely abusing that. So, you know, those who wanted to move out their capital, they did it. Then they saw that, okay, you know, as Russia said, Ukraine will last three days.
       </p>
          <p>
          Foreign investors, they saw that it didn't happen, so they moved that capital back. And again, as I said, even now, Ukraine has been attracting foreign capital, especially for military warfare drone projects. Yep, and then it kind of moves into my last question that I have for you. That's, you know, from an economist's perspective, how important are credible long-term security guarantees, whether from NATO, the EU, or some form from the IMF or any other organization in stabilizing expectations and supporting recovery in Ukraine Yeah, this is another great question. I think Ukraine, not just because of this war specifically or the invasion of 2014, I think Ukraine lost trust in guarantees from foreign states, primarily because, as you know, when Ukraine gave up nuclear weapons, some countries, including Russia and the United States, guaranteed us territorial integrity and state sovereignty.
       </p>
         Yes, yes, it didn't happen. And I remember that when the full-scale war just started, I remember that, again, as you know, people who were doing rallies in D.C. And advocating for Ukraine, we were bringing up, you know, that infamous Budapest Memorandum so many times. U.S. has pretty, you know, like pretty clear position that, like, forget about that. So that was kind of a guarantee, you know? Yeah, true. And one country violated that guarantee, Russia, in 2014, and the other country decided not to honor that guarantee. Again, as I always say, we're thankful for the support that U.S. has been providing But so far, I think that one of the reasons why the peace negotiations are, you know, so much delayed and we see it's on and on and on, not only because we see them, certain actors are, you know, trying to follow all interests but not Ukraine's, but also because the Ukrainian government thinks really, you know, makes a lot of effort to think out of the box because when you're a neighbor to the empire, you know, whichever it's called, Russian empire, Soviet Union, or Russian Federation, it's kind of, there's actually nothing that can stop this empire from future invasion.
       </p>
          <p>
         So I, not being part of the Ukrainian government, or, you know, somebody who works in international law, I have no idea what shape or form those guarantees have to be I don't know, you know, it should be something like the king of kings of all guarantees. I don't know what should it be, you know, either like Russia invades Ukraine, or other countries, and NATO, you know, press the red button immediately. But the problem is that they are probably not going to be able to put it into guarantees.
          </p>
         <p>
         So the honest question is, I don't know what has to be done. You know, how those guarantees should be so much interconnected across, you know, NATO countries, you know, some other European countries that are not part of NATO, some European countries that are not of the EU, but part of NATO, I have no idea. I have no idea. It should be definitely something so creative and new and out of the box that I guess we people who are not involved in creating, you know, designing those guarantees, we just have no idea about that. But I think something that will at least delay Russia's possible future invasions of Ukraine or Moldova or Georgia, because, you know, all of them were invaded previously by Russia, or Baltic states that are part of NATO but feel so much vulnerable because they have no idea if they will be backed up, you know, in case of something happened. 
       </p>
         <p>
         I think that the, you know, total defeat of Russia can be at least some guarantee, for example, for Ukraine that, okay, we have another, let's say, 20 years to do all of our homework, you know, in terms of corruption, in terms of developing this perfect space for investors, you know, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, capital mobility, military, industrial complex, our own defense, not being so much reliant on other countries. I think it's also very important because you don't know, right And I guess what they feel, like the most recent elections in the United States, I mean, not the most recent, but those 20, 21 showed that you can, you know, it's kind of a risk to 100% rely on anyone, because even if Americans support Ukraine, you know, there can be government that, you know, will be doing something completely different in changing the trajectory of the cooperation.
       </p>
         <p>
         So I think, you know, Russia being defeated and then recovering for next, I don't know, 20, 50, 100 years in Ukraine, rebuilding itself, becoming more attractive for foreign investment, you know, maybe even becoming this hub of, you know, electronic small drones warfare, because I think this is actually what is happening right now at this point Being, you know, fully independent in terms of defending ourselves, Ukraine is a country that, you know, has never planned to invade anyone around us, that's for sure. We're a large country, Ukraine, but we're still a small open economy right now. So, you know, it's kind of sad because the only guarantee that I see right now is the total defeat of Russia, yeah. 
          <p>
         <strong><em>Kaylin</em></strong>: And just to follow up on that, what does the total defeat of Russia look like?
          </p>
         <p>
         <strong><em>Mariia</em></strong>: Oh, it's another good question, you know, because I feel like right now, people don't know how Ukraine's victory looks like, so that, you know, Putin is not too much offended. Or what is Russia's total defeat? Well, I think number one is the collapse of the Russian Federation, as we know. There are many subjects of the Russian Federation that, since 1991, wanted to become an independent state. And I know subjects like Chechnya, for example, are one of those with two invasions of Russia in the 1990s and then early 2000s, when Putin was already elected as a president. I think there definitely should be something done with nuclear weapons. Yeah, it's a big one. Exactly, because so far, you know, Ukraine followed the rule, you know, we were pressured, we gave up our nuclear weapons.
          </p>
         <p>
           Funny enough, we gave it up basically to Russia, because the way how the EU and the US saw that they wanted Russia, isn't that crazy? Have everything, everything from Kazakhstan, from Ukraine, which were the other largest arsenals inside the Soviet Union. And Ukraine was, I think, the second largest arsenal in the world if I'm not mistaken. So as long as Russia has it, and, you know, will be always threatening that, you know, we will, or we will push the button, or we'll push the button. I don't know if, you know, anyone around Russia can feel safe because, you know, those countries, including Ukraine, will always feel that pressure. Yeah, I think that definitely the recognition of war crimes. Yeah, of course. And, you know, not what I think was proposed in this peace deal.
           <p>
            Like, oh, let's just hug and forget about everything. I mean, this is not, this cannot happen. There's no peace deal. Absolutely, there's no peace deal. And I think there's no, right, defeat of Russia, basically, if you want to construct how it looks like, right? The world, including Russia, hopefully, you know, has to admit that this is what happened. Ukraine has no intent in invading Russia. NATO has, you know, funny enough, NATO has no intent in accepting Ukraine into NATO, and NATO has no intent, had no intent in invading Russia. And Russia, Russians, they have to be punished for what they have done to Ukraine. And there's a separate project in Ukraine that's called Russia must pay, where academics, you know, civil society are basically collecting the whole database of any damage that Russia has done.
          </p>
         <p>
           Obviously, we cannot include, you know, all those people who were killed, tortured, raped, traumatized into that database. So Russia must pay, Russia must pay for everything, returning abducted Ukrainian kids, prisoners of war, civilians. You know, funny enough, this is not of this so-called peace deal right now. Can you imagine? I mean, not returning abducted kids that have their families in Ukraine, or, you know, at least some extended family members, you know, anyone who can be their legal official guardian. So there should be some, you know, part of Russia's defeat is justice. Justice for Ukraine. I think, you know, a good way to put it would be Russian accountability on Russia's part, not simply a slap on the wrist for the full scale invasion of Ukraine, but making sure that there actually is some punishment for what happened.Oh, it's just not, let's just not go back to the way we were. 
          </p>
                        
       </p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>Question 4 & Discussion</strong><p>
        <p>
      <strong><em>Kaylin</em></strong>: Yeah, yeah. And, you know, this kind of just in the close up here, my closing question is, is there anything else that you think people outside Ukraine should know about the economic impact of the war on Ukraine's economy?
        </p>
  <p>
   <strong><em>Mariia</em></strong>:  I mean, think about when you're thinking about the economic impact of the full scale war, you know, regardless if you want to think about social impact, socio-economic impact, financial impact, you know, mental impact, psychological impact, trading impact, anything, anything, anything, just think about the Second World War. Think about Poland, think about the European countries, think about actually Ukraine during the Second World War. We were, you know, destroyed absolutely. It was just horrendous. My grandparents, I was lucky enough to hear those stories from people who witnessed that. They were kids, but they witnessed that. Think about that. 
    </p>
      <p>
        Don't think about some isolated, you know, like small conflict, how it's been called. No, it's all over Ukraine. Ukraine is a big country. Not many people know that it's the largest country in Europe. Sometimes people name Russia, to be honest. I think geopolitically, I don't know, like psychologically, I think Russia is completely Asia in terms of everything they're doing. Yes, there is a European part of Russia, but Ukraine is the largest country in Europe. So, think about this huge country. I don't know, go into Google Maps and just compare the size of Ukraine to even Poland, to Germany, to France, to the United Kingdom.
      </p>
       <p>
      Just look how huge it is and just think about that. Basically, every night almost every region is under constant attack, either, you know, either being attacked by some long-distance missiles or those Iranian drones, or something that Russia had created by themselves, some sort of drones. So, just think about that. Think about, you know, people are not being able, next day after attack, people are not being able, for example, to go to work just because, let's say, that bridge that was connecting, you know, left bank of the river and right bank of the river was completely destroyed by Russia. So, you know, we can talk about this huge macro impact, which, you know, this dramatic drop in GDP in 2020, but we can also think as, you know, just individuals, just try to imagine you're under attack every day, just try to, you know, imagine what impact it, you know, would have on your income, on your finance, on your property, you know, everything that you have.
 </p>  
         <p>
           You know, like, think about inflation that is, you know, in 2022, it, you know, grew up dramatically. And again, just because this is something that is happening during wars like that, think about that you, you know, today you went to the supermarket and next day you see that you cannot afford something anymore, just because, oh my God, the price, you know, tripled, quadrupled and everything that is there So, I would suggest to, you know, think about both macro level in terms of figures. You know, never harms to go and actually check like hard data, hard macroeconomic data, but also just, you know, I don't know. For example, Google Ukrainian documentaries about full-scale invasion of Russia, you know, just, I don't know. I'm sure even in YouTube you can go there and you can just look.
       </p>
             <p>
               You can just watch videos from different parts of Ukraine, you know. Somebody's walking to get coffee and, oh, wow, there's like a drone attack. And so, you know, like those small impacts, negative impacts that actually destroy people's lives and then have been aggregated on this macro level. Yeah. So, just think about both of those levels, yeah. But we're talking about people, you know.
       </p>
                 <p>
                   <strong><em>Kaylin</em></strong>: Yeah, I think that's a good way to live because yes, you can look at it from an economic perspective, you can look at it from that macro level, but at the end of the day, that macro level is going to affect people in Ukraine, it's going to affect their livelihood, and that perspective is like incredibly important. Yeah, absolutely. And I just want to say thank you for taking the time to do this interview with me, it's been a pleasure to do this. Thank you so much, this is my final assignment for this semester.
       </p>
                <p>    
         <strong><em>Mariia</em></strong>: Sounds good. Those questions were really cool. Thank you, thank you. 
                </p>
       <p>
         <strong><em>Kaylin</em></strong>: This interview ended up being 55 minutes long, but that's perfectly fine. (Laughing)
