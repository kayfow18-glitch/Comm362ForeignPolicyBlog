    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>December 7th</em></p>

    <p>
      I am aware this is incredibly long. I had script running in the background during this video that transcribed the transcript for me, so it didn’t take me too long to get this together. At this point, it’s probably clear I can’t ever do anything halfway.</p>

     </p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>Introduction</strong><p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Kaylin</em></strong>: This is my final blog post for the semester. I will be doing an interview with my friend here, my work colleague that I work with, and I will start with, you know, an introduction for her. And could you briefly introduce yourself and your connection to Ukraine's economic situation? 
    </p>
    
    <p>
       <strong><em>Mariia</em></strong>: Yeah, thank you, Kaylin. My name is Maria Panga. Right now I am a PhD student at George Mason University. I'm doing a PhD in public policy. I'm Ukrainian, [and] before moving to the United States, I received my master's degree in economic analysis at Kyiv School of Economics, and then for five years I have been working for the Ukrainian Central Bank, like think about Fed in the United States at the Financial Stability Department. So I, you know, have both hard textbook knowledge about economics generally, but also about both economic and financial situation in Ukraine since I don't know almost forever and including right now as well, of course. 
    </p>
        </p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>Question 1</strong><p>
      <p>
      <strong><em>Kaylin</em></strong>: Sounds great. I'm going to move into some questions that I have for you. The first one is about Ukraine's macroeconomic trajectory. My question for you is how has the war reshaped Ukraine's long-term economic trajectory and which sectors do you expect will define Ukraine's post-war recovery.
      </p>
        <p>
          <strong><em>Mariia</em></strong>:  Oh, wow, great question. I mean, the impact was and is, you know, horrible, the most devastating that we've experienced since the Second World War. Although we had a few macroeconomic crises before 2022, this is the worst that we've ever experienced.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, just to compare the numbers between 2022, the beginning of the full-scale invasion, and the first invasion of Russia in 2013 with annexation of Crimea, and then 2015 with the beginning of the battlefield war in the eastern regions. For example, in 2015, the GDP dropped around 12%, which was, you know, just a disaster back then. In 2022, GDP dropped by 30%. And the other reason why in 2022 it didn't drop even more is because, you know, after 2015, Ukraine went through some important reforms. So this is why the whole economic and financial sector was more resilient than before in 2014, 2015. As I said, the impact is horrible. Although in 2023 and 2024, we witnessed the economic growth, but you know, basically it happened just because the drop was so huge.
        </p>
          <p>
          And yeah, not because, you know, the war became anything better or didn't have less impact. But, you know, because economy was in such a shock in 2022 So then 2023, 2024, there was just a kind of natural grow from this horrible drop. So in 2023, it grew, I think around 5.56%. In 2024, it was less, it was around 2. 53%. And next year, well, basically this year, I think the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian Central Bank, they expect not more than 3%, but probably is going to be something like 2%. The impact on the sectors was definitely different, but it hit all of the sectors, that's for sure. You know, everything that is related to, for example, you know, power generation, anything that is related to utilities, servicing, it probably was one of the sectors that, you know, was harmed a lot.
        </p>
          <p>
            And just because Russia targeted power generation stations, et cetera, et cetera, it basically affected. It has like an additional effect on all other businesses, you know, obviously for civilians as well, but all other businesses, well, you can just imagine, right, that, um, if you don't have, you know, power, if you don't have electricity at your business, at your office, at your plant, factory, uh, it, it pretty painful. 2022, 2023, it was like a jazzing period when, um, many businesses and different sectors, they, um, you know, started just thinking, so, okay, we're not expecting that it will be getting any better, uh, so what can we do? And this is when, um, businesses started buying like, uh, like small power generators.
        </p>
          <p>
            Power generators, of course, it doesn't work for large, uh, like manufacturers, but there have been a lot of relocation, basically where possible, from Eastern central regions to the Western. Uh, those regions are also under attack on the West, but they're closer to the EU and native border. And there's this expectation that, you know, Russia should be less, you know, less brutal, but actually, unfortunately, it didn't work, um, like that, um, you know, obviously, the sectors that, um, I think were affected not as much were, you know, um, IT, some corporate services, but only because many of those contractors and professionals, they were able to move to some of the EU countries, but they still are working for Ukrainian businesses. Yeah.
        </p>
          <p>
            Uh, but you know, anything else that we can think that is connected to, um, infrastructures has been in a, in a pretty bad form. Uh, there's definitely a growth in, um, military, uh, you know, drones production sector, surprisingly, but, uh, Ukraine, uh, has managed to, has been managing to attract some foreign direct investments that are dedicated specifically for those, uh, military warfare sectors. 
            </p>
          <p>
            <strong><em>Kaylin</em></strong>: Um, yeah, I mean, that was great. That was a wonderful answer. And I guess I just, uh, have a follow-up question to that. Um, kind of looking at Ukraine post-war, um, you know, when the war's over, do you expect Ukraine's economy to become more export diversified, especially with, you know, Ukraine's beginning to get more allies, especially within the EU, within NATO as they become closer to them, or do you expect them to be sort of more dependent on those few key sectors that have started to, um, gain some traction, um, before and during the war?
            </p>
          <p>
            <strong><em>Mariia</em></strong>: Uh, so, so Ukraine is the, one of the largest agri-products, agriculture sector exporters Uh, Ukraine has been also exporting a lot of, um, let's say iron ore, everything related to metal, metallurgic sector. Um, if we're talking about agriculture sector, um, we are still exporting, uh, we definitely export less, uh, I mean, we as Ukraine, and, um, we, Ukraine has been trading with the EU, NATO countries, you know, since, since the collapse of Soviet Union, um, it's, um, it was getting better after Ukraine signed, um, the, um, association, it's like association agreement with the EU, and I think Ukraine is an EU candidate right now, but the path is, you know, completely ambiguous at this point So Ukraine, before 2022, I think Ukraine has done a lot of homework in terms of, if we're talking about agriculture, food processing sector.
        </p>
                <p>
                  Ukraine has done a lot of work on packaging, you know, following and being compliant with all of the EU regulations. Yep. So, um, Ukraine has been exporting everything that Ukraine exported before 2022 to the EU countries, but definitely the amount of products being exported is less. We have been also supplying a lot of agricultural items to basically one of the poorest countries in Asia and Africa. And right now Ukraine struggles with just collecting the grain. So actually, those countries, I don't even know whether they were able to substitute because Ukraine used to sell it cheaper than other countries. So if we're talking about agriculture and food processing industry, I think once the fields are demined and the problems with power generation are resolved, I think that we will just go back to the previous figures of exporting those items. And the second part of your question?
        </p>
                      <p>
                        <strong><em>Kaylin</em></strong>: Will Ukraine sort of depend on those few key sectors like agriculture, or will they become more export diversified? Will Ukraine look to other types of exports to generate GDP? 
        </p>
                      <p>
                    <strong><em>Mariia</em></strong>: You know, it's a tricky question because we still don't know. I mean, if we're talking about ideal peace agreement for Ukraine, you know, basically going to the state of, you know, 2021 and, you know, maybe to the borders of 1991, hopefully, then we'll just go back to our, you know, pretty diversified export portfolio where we'll go back to exporting mining industry outputs, metallurgy. I mean, food processing and agriculture should just, I don't know, maybe become even larger in terms of like revenue for Ukraine and also values.
                      </p>
          <p> 
            So, I mean, I'm not expecting that any of those sectors will, you know, significantly skyrocket because, you know, we have obviously, you know, some certain amount of the crop that we can have, we cannot like jump over that, how it was before. I think that something that might actually grow up significantly, it's military and warfare production sector. And not only in terms of, you know, like specific, I don't know, drones, but also expert of R&D, basically. And, you know, there's also a lot of talking about Ukraine's minerals, right; they are essential for electronics and warfare as well. So, maybe this is going to be another sector in terms of export that will arise. The trade with, you know, Russia and some other post-Soviet countries that, you know, clearly joined Russia in this war against Ukraine.
        </p>
              <p>
                I don't see how it will be recovering because basically since 2015, we, 2014, 2015, we stopped any trade and we were not affected in those terms of exporting. So, I think that the, you know, Asia, Africa, and the EU countries, I think it will still be our main trade partners.
              </p>
          <strong><em>Kaylin</em></strong>: That's a great, you know, way to close that. I think, like you said, it is idealistic. We have to assume that, you know, a peace plan is going to be in place that doesn't harm Ukraine. And it's kind of hard to project, you know, where the economy is going to go because we don't really know what the end of the war is going to look like.
           <p>

    </p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>Question 2</strong><p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Kaylin</em></strong>: And kind of moving into my next question, it's about physical stability and aid dependence for Ukraine. Ukraine's budget is heavily supported by foreign assistance, primarily through their neighbors in Europe. The US has become a little bit more wishy-washy with the Trump administration. But I want to ask, from an economist's perspective, what does a sustainable balance between domestic revenue generation for Ukraine and foreign aid look like during and after the war, assuming we have a peace plan that is beneficial and right for Ukraine? 
    </p>
    <strong><em>Mariia</em></strong>: Okay, okay. Yeah, that's a good point to answer because we can think about so many things. Well, it's, you know, it's a good and it's very complicated question in terms of Ukraine's budget. And, well, we're basically talking about revenue generated from Ukrainian taxpayers. You know, Ukraine has been raising its tax base in Ukraine since 2022, something that, you know, is happening whenever a war, a country is in, you know, a full-scale war like Ukraine is right now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, the IMF and EU assistance were a huge, huge help. I mean, you know, very significant assistance because Ukraine in this position when, you know, it needs not only defend Ukraine, defend itself, defend Ukraine. And even during the war, Ukraine still has been, you know, restoring or building some, you know, residential buildings, power generating facilities, bridges, you know, anything that you can think about infrastructure because, yeah, it might be damaged again, but you don't have any other choice. You cannot just leave it where it is. So, Ukraine has to do all of that, but also Ukraine has to keep managing, you know, its social welfare function. And in those terms, of course, it was, you know, it was pretty significant.
     </p>
      <p>
        Just the idea of imagining Ukraine dealing with this by itself without, no, I'm not even talking about, you know, military help with weapons, but without any financial support, well, it will be pretty tough because, you know, we still have, you know, a pretty big, even a pretty big budget sector, government sector that, you know, still needs to be working. So, if we're talking about what is happening right now, you know, this is what me and my colleagues as part of advocacy efforts for Ukraine here in DC, we're always talking that, you know, it's, we're very grateful, but it's never enough. It never has been enough. So, so far, you know, it's so hard to just look at Ukraine's budget, how hard it is actually to manage the revenues and expenses, and you know, always, yeah, just, you know, they don't have any other choice, the government relying on, you know, either grants or loans.
    </p>
          <p>
            It's always part of the Ukrainian budget since 2022. Of course, you know, grants are so much better than loans. And again, Ukraine is, you know, is in a desperate position. So, we don't have any other choice, but even accepting, you know, those loans that are, you know, pretty, pretty costly in terms of interest rate. But so far, our partners, Ukraine's partners were, you know, very understanding in terms of, you know, going through changing, you know, interest rate or maturity of the loan in terms of, like, paying back the loan and the interest. So, it's been pretty tough. If we're talking about the future and, you know, the ideal plan for Ukraine and, you know, the very important part of this is, you know, Russia paying for the damag
    </p>
              <p>
          If this is part of the peace deal, which I think, you know, has to be. It must be because otherwise it just doesn't have any sense. I think that definitely, and we're talking about, right, at least $300 billion At least, it should be more because the damage exceeds so far twice, I don't know, three times what the damage is, and obviously we cannot even evaluate all the lives that were lost, you know, all the, I don't know, people that are alive but have been traumatized so much by, you know, any type of, you know, every type of war crimes that Russia committed to Ukrainians I think in that case the reliance on EU and the US will be going down, but going down only in terms of, you know, grants and loans, because Ukraine expects to have a lot of projects for reconstruction and rebuilding, where other countries, and specifically, you know, those countries that supported Ukraine, not those countries that were, you know, just actively killing
    </p>
      <p>
        Ukrainians, or those countries that were just like, you know, saying that they're neutral, but those countries that were actively supporting Ukraine. I think that they will have, you know, a lot of business interest in investing in Ukraine and having reconstruction and rebuilding projects and ultimately preparing for long-term cooperation. I think, you know, if all of that is actually happening, I think Ukraine will be able to, you know, repay everything and growing, you know, in terms of GDP, unemployment, you know, should go down for sure.           
    </p>
       <p>
         <strong><em>Kaylin</em></strong>: The kind of total economic situation, financial situation, I think it should be improving. Yeah, and on that last point about, you know, there's potential investment opportunities for the EU, I know that recently, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has floated the idea of forming an anti-Ukraine bloc with Slovakia and the Czech Republic, with Fico and Babiš. And so when you get those three no votes in the EU, it becomes very hard for the EU to support Ukraine. What risk do you see if donor support from the EU is stymied because of opposition in the EU? 
          <p>
           <strong><em>Mariia</em></strong>: Yeah, well, just going back a little bit, you know, when I said about the, you know, future investment projects, I think it will not be only the EU. I think, you know, we're talking about the United States as well; we're talking about countries like, oh God, I wanted to say North Korea, South Korea, and Japan, for example, those who have been, you know, pretty much supporting Ukraine in humanitarian aid, you know, different types of aid. And, you know, basically, countries around the world who are supporting Ukraine, not trying to, you know, damage Ukraine more. In terms of this anti-Ukrainian bloc, I think that, you know, Czech Republic, like Orban put there. Czech Republic, I think it will not happen, because Czech Republic anyway was pretty supportive. 
    </p>
                <p>
               <strong><em>Kaylin</em></strong>: Yeah, that's what I've also done some research on, they have been, but their incoming Prime Minister has sort of floated the idea. He is a populist. He has met with Orban a couple of times and he wants to revitalize the Visegrad group. So his whole point is he wants to, you know, get those countries together. And this is something that has been, you know, on the table, it's not set in stone. Do I think it'll happen? Probably not. Because like you said, the Czech Republic is sort of, you know, they have supported Ukraine, but it is a possibility So that's why I was just curious, because obviously the EU is on Ukraine's doorstep. They are the EU, or Ukraine is a candidate member state for the EU, so they do get a lot of support from them. And if, you know, that support is even more stifling. Poland was also initially, right? But obviously Poland.
    </p>
                      <p>
                  <strong><em>Mariia</em></strong>: Yeah, Poland's no, yeah, Poland's, yeah, yeah. Well, the president of the Czech Republic, Fiala, he is very supportive of Ukraine. If we're talking about those two other EU countries, and especially Orbán, because he was the major anti-Ukrainian power there, so far the EU somehow was able to overcome those obstacles. I think as long as the EU might have, let's say in the future, some reconstruction projects in the EU, and maybe at that time Orbán will not be in power, because we don't kno
    </p>
       <p>
         <strong><em>Kaylin</em></strong>: They have elections next spring, so that is true. And what I've heard about Hungarians who, for different reasons, come here, they all say sorry and they're embarrassed about everything that is going on there.
    </p>
             <p>
               <strong><em>Mariia</em></strong>: I think for Orbán, as long as Russia will be defeated, because again, this is the ideal peace plan that we're talking about right now, I think that it will change, even if he is still in power. Because I don't think that there is a huge support from the Hungarian population. 
             </p>
      <p>
         <strong><em>Kaylin</em></strong>: Yeah, I would agree with that. I think it's mainly at a federal government level for Hungary. Orbán, I mean, he's Putin's puppet, so he's got to do all of this stuff at the EU level. But from what I understand, public sentiment, Hungarians are very supportive of Ukraine because they do know that if Russia ever tried to expand, that they could be on the list. So it is their due diligence to support Ukraine, so I think that is a good perspective on that as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><em>Mariia</em></strong>: Yeah, but again, there are so many moving parts, as you know, and sometimes it's not even clear in terms of Orbán. Sorry for elaborating on that, but it's not even clear if he will be more listening to Russia or the United States, because it looks like he has a very high hope and expectations in terms of Hungarian and the US cooperation. Although it's a little bit funny because Hungary itself is not part of the EU, it's this small open economy, and the US economy is just gigantic, so Hungary will benefit. The US probably will not even feel it, so I think it also depends on what signal will be coming from the United States, from the administration in the future. Yeah, that was a great conversation about that question.
      </p> 
                  
       </p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>Question 3</strong><p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Kaylin</em></strong>: Yeah, that was a great conversation about that question. I think you kind of touched on this a little bit, but I did want to ask, I think you, like I said, you did mention it, but what conditions need to be in place politically, institutionally, militarily for international investors to view Ukraine as a viable space for post-war reconstruction?
