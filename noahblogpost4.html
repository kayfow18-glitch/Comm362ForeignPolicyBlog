      </p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>Introduction</strong><p>
    <p>
      	Following President Donald Trump’s victory there was much debate surrounding what his administration would mean for the United State’s unofficial relationship with Taiwan. Predictions varied wildly, with some in Taiwan believing it would largely follow in the footsteps of the Biden administration. Others, remembering several events during the Trump administration, insisted it would be a return to a transactional relationship, something that could open Taipei up to increased pressure from Beijing. How exactly has the Trump administration departed from Biden’s Taiwan policies? Where has Trump kept policies in place? This paper will explore that through three categories, defense, engagement, and trade. 
    </p>
    
      </p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>Defense</strong><p>
  
      <p>
      	In his first year as President, Trump has overall remained roughly consistent in his approach to arming Taiwan and preparing for a possible contingency with China. In November, he authorized the sale of F-16 parts and munitions, the first Foreign Military Sale case to Taiwan in nearly a year, and one of the largest in quite some time. However, several weeks prior to this sale, he delayed an estimated $400 million in Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) weaponry that was slated to be delivered, as Trump was seemingly worried that it would derail ongoing trade negotiations with China. 
    </p>

      <p>
      These two examples illustrate Trump’s overall strategy towards Taiwan, which is to encourage the Taiwanese to directly buy more of their foreign equipment through the FMS/DCS process and rely less on US stockpiles, while also encouraging an increase in domestic spending. This specifically contrasts substantially from the Biden administration, which routed a significant amount of munitions to Taiwan through the PDA structure, mostly to circumvent the incredibly large backlog of FMS/DCS cases that currently sits at over $21 billion.
      </p>

    </figure>
        
        <p>
        Posture wise, Trump has shown a cautious acceptance of the strengthened regional posture created under the Biden administration. Freedom of navigation operations in the Taiwan Strait, for instance, have continued but at a slightly slower pace than what was seen in the Biden administration. These operations are important, as they are one of the only ways the US military actively showcases its military in Taiwan’s direct proximity. 
        </p>
    
      </p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>Engagement</strong><p>

    <p>
      	The Trump administration has not continued the rather bold series of official interactions between Taiwanese and American officials that occurred through much of the Biden administration. In July, Trump officials pressured Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te to cancel his stopover trip to the United States en route to Latin America, for fear of provoking Chinese wrath in the tariff negotiations going on at that time. Instead, US and Taiwanese defense and political officials have held a number of secret meetings, one of which occurred in late August in Alaska, far from the spotlight that might send Beijing into a rage over violations of the Sino-American understandings over Taiwan. 
    </p>
    	Trump has also remained muted on the Taiwan issue broadly, downplaying its importance in the Sino-American relationship and renewing the US’s policy of strategic ambiguity. Biden notoriously broke from that longstanding policy, which had begun under the Reagan administration, when he openly announced his intention to defend Taiwan in 2021. For many, this was a bridge too far, although it was fairly popular in Taiwan for obvious reasons. Trump was heavily critical of Nancy Pelosi’s 2022 visit to Taiwan, something often cited by regional experts as the breaking point in cross-Strait relations.
      <p>
          
  </p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>Trade</strong><p>

    <p>
      	Trump’s sweeping tariffs have perhaps been the most consequential aspect of his foreign policy towards Taiwan. As of early December, Taiwan and the United States have still not come to an agreement on a trade deal, despite the US reaching deals with many other major allies and partners, and even some adversaries including China. This has caused serious economic turmoil in Taiwan, and had a chilling effect on how Taiwanese view the United States writ large. 
     </p>

    <p>
      	Perhaps more ominous for Taiwan, Trump has taken issue with several parts of the CHIPS act, legislation passed under the Biden administration that offered substantial support for the TSMC’s ongoing business in the United States. Instead, Trump has pressed Taiwan to directly invest that money into the US economy, not so subtly hinting that it might be a quid-pro-quo for the relationship and the US’s continued investment in its defense. 
  </p>
          
      </p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>Summary</strong><p>
        
        <p> 
          	While Trump has continued some of the Biden administration’s reforms to the United States’ Taiwan policy and broader posture in the Indo-Pacific, its hyper-focus on trade reform has caused them to walk back significant engagement and economic relations with Taiwan, out of fear of prolonging negotiations with the PRC. For now, it seems that Trump has decided that Taiwan will be dealt with in a transactional relationship, where it will get back what it invests in the United States, if it’s lucky.
