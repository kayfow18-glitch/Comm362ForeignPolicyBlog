      Throughout his career, Novak Djokovic has been a trailblazer. He encapsulates everything tennis is not: abrasive, curt, and sometimes even downright disrespectful. He was infamously disqualified from the 2020 US Open for hitting a ball in anger that inadvertently hit a line judge standing in the area (Bodo, 2020). His disqualification came as he was slated to win, at the time, his 18th Grand Slam title because other top players withdrew due to injury or lost in earlier rounds. In January of 2022, he was deported from Australia because he refused to abide by the Australian Government’s regulation on the COVID-19 vaccine, which earned him the nickname “Novax Djokovic” (Hurst, 2022). In light of this decision, Serbs began protesting in the streets in support of Djokovic, and the Prime Minister of Serbia at the time, Ana Brnabić, was unhappy with the decision in Australia (Henley, 2022). 
    </p>
    While it is evident that Djokovic has had a tumultuous past few years, he is still beloved in Serbia. In 2024, he was able to “complete” tennis by winning his first gold medal at the Paris Olympics in July. When he returned to Serbia in August, he was celebrated by Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, and many Serbs came to celebrate him at Belgrade City Hall (ATP Staff, 2024). However, Djokovic's relationship with Serbia has become strained since that celebration in August. While the public still supports him, Serbia’s government and its heavily regulated media now brand Djokovic as a traitor for supporting protestors and for his subsequent move to Greece (West, 2025). 
    <p>
      As a result, the controversy surrounding Djokovic has moved well beyond questions of his athletic fame. He has become a focal point in a shifting soft-power landscape in the Balkans, where political elites have heavily leaned on famous figures to bolster their legitimacy. Serbia’s current governance policies, marred by corruption, media disenfranchisement, and authoritarian ideology, have led to a crisis that Djokovic’s actions expose.

        In November 2024, a concrete canopy at a railway station in Novi Sad collapsed, killing 16 people (Moench & Delauney, 2024). Renovations at this railway station began in 2021, and it was initially scheduled to open on July 5th, 2024. Railway Infrastructure of Serbia, which was responsible for the renovations, said that they did not rebuild the canopy, despite it being from 1964. This new station connecting Serbia’s second-largest city to Belgrade, the capital, and Budapest, Hungary, was supposed to be a symbol of progress (Delauney, 2025). Nevertheless, it ended up encapsulating the very thing that's wrong with Serbia: it reeks of corruption. An infrastructure project undertaken by the government ended up killing 16 innocent people. 
      </p>
        <p>
          This crisis has sparked a movement of resistance against the Serbian government, primarily led by college students (Delauney, 2025). In some aspects, these protests have been successful. In January of 2025, then-Prime Minister of Serbia, Milos Vucevic, resigned following these widespread protests. Yet, President Vucic has repeatedly claimed that there will be no regime change and that change is not needed (Bunkall, 2025). For the most part, these protests by Serbian students have also been nonviolent; they do not seek to become what they are fighting against. These students hope for greater transparency and less corruption from their government; they believe these factors caused the disaster in Novi Sad. In this sense, the Novi Sad collapse was not a mere accident but a catalyst for Serbian youth to protest their government. The students knew that what they began to do and are currently doing is a precarious move, but Serbia’s national hero has legitimized them. 
        </p>
    <p>
      By showing support for the student protestors, Djokovic has taken himself from a national hero to a political actor. He has always supported the students in Serbia, but he began to up the stakes in how he showed his support. His first public announcement of support was via social media, specifically Twitter (now X) in December 2024, where he stated: “...The strength of young people and their desire for a better future, I believe it is important for their voices to be heard” and “What we all need is understanding and respect. With you, Novak” (Djokovic, 2024). When Djokovic believes he has to share something, he never goes about it quietly. At the Australian Open in early January of 2025, after he defeated Tomas Machac in the third round, he wrote on the camera, “За Софи” (For Sonja), a woman who was injured when a car ran her over at a protest (Shahi, 2025). He continued to voice his support for Sonja in a press conference after the match and reiterated his call for peace.

    <p>
      In late January 2025, when Djokovic was back in Serbia and at a famous basketball game, he wore a hoodie with the words “Students Are Champions” (Shahi, 2025). Most recently, in a display of support for the protestors, Djokovic celebrated winning a Wimbledon match by making a pumping gesture with his arms, something synonymous with the protestors in Serbia; they have a slogan called “Pumpaj,” which quite literally means “keep pumping” (Fraser, 2025). 
      <p>
          <p>  
            This turn for Djokovic is important because he has never been explicit about his political views. They have always been implied, and people assumed he would become more political as his tennis career wound down (and, in some respects, they are right). He is throwing himself headfirst into a highly contentious political issue and can no longer claim neutrality. Djokovic’s support for the protestors matters immensely because it gives them legitimacy and visibility, particularly in the West. For Serbia’s government, Djokovic is no longer an asset; he becomes a threat to its rule. 
          </p>
    <p>
      	Serbia’s government, led at the moment by Vucic, has been highly critical of Djokovic for his support of the protestors, but that sentiment is relatively new. Vucic used to be close to Djokovic, respecting him for the great things he did for Serbia on the world stage. He even once promised to build a Djokovic museum in Belgrade upon his retirement, much as Spain did for Rafael Nadal (Briggs, 2025). Alas, that was before Djokovic started speaking out against Vucic and his Serbian Progressive Party. Vucic has also stated that he would never say anything bad about Djokovic, no matter what happens. 
      </p>

    <p>
      However, the tabloid (most media in Serbia could be described as a tabloid; there is very little media freedom in Serbia), Informer (which many believe is controlled by the Vucic government or even Vucic himself), called Djokovic a “disgrace” (Briggs, 2025). The tabloid also called Djokovic “a false patriot…,” and it makes sense that the President of Serbia would be upset that the country’s national hero is turning on him, so he has to respond by painting him as a traitor. The most important part of this tabloid was, though, the line containing: “...[Djokovic] presented himself as a symbol of Serbia for years only to now flee to Greece,” showing how serious Djokovic is about supporting the protestors. The loss of a soft-power icon threatens Vucic’s legitimacy, and his responses have risked souring diplomatic relations with Greece, where Djokovic now lives.
          </p>
  <p>
    Given the Vucic government's animosity towards Djokovic and his care for his family, he officially relocated to Greece. He bought a home in Athens, and it has been agreed that he will apply for a “Golden Visa” to formally become a Greek citizen (THN Staff, 2025). He has always spoken about Greece affectionately, so this move makes sense. Djokovic has called Greece and Serbia “brothers,” so he sees the countries as somewhat similar. The tennis tournament, the Belgrade Open, which was hosted in Belgrade and run by Djokovic’s brother, Djordje, was moved from the capital city to Athens (Fraser, 2025). Now called the Hellenic Championships, the inaugural tournament took place in the first week of November 2025, which Djokovic ended up winning. 
    </p>
      <p>
        This move also was not something Djokovic had been planning for a long time; it came up suddenly. He told a Greek news outlet that “Actually, in the last two years, things have happened, decisions have changed in our lives, both privately and professionally…” which can be taken as his way of saying that the turmoil in Serbia had taken a toll on him and his family (Fraser, 2025). From the Serbian government’s perspective, it appears that Djokovic abandoned them, but it was they who caused this in the first place. 
      </p>

    <p>
      Djokovic has been Serbia’s main soft-power asset on the global stage for the past 20 years. This type of power enabled Serbia to influence people around the world through admiration or symbolic pride in its citizens, thereby bolstering its identity. His dissent from the Vucic regime shows how his symbolic power can transcend his profession and become a political threat to a regime in power. Whether he knows it or not, by legitimizing students in Belgrade and across Serbia, protests against governments like Vucic’s may gain more popularity or seek out other soft-power assets from their country to legitimize their protest movements. While some may claim that Djokovic is the greatest tennis player of all time, what he has done and is currently doing for students in Serbia is resonating deeply with many Serbs because of his sway there. Whether Djokovic is viewed as a traitor or a hero depends on your outlook, but his choices do reveal how fragile politics and national pride are in the Balkans and how soft power can be weaponized on a foreign stage.
