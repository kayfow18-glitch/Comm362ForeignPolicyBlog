      On September 9th, when European Commission President Ursula von Der Leyen gave her State of the Union address to the European Parliament, she made a bold claim about the Israeli-Palestine conflict. Von der Leyen boldly said of Gaza: “And I know that for many citizens, Europe's inability to agree on a common way forward is equally painful. They are asking how much worse things must get before there is a unity of response. I understand. Because what is happening in Gaza is unacceptable. Acknowledgement of this issue from the European Union’s top official definitely meant changes were coming regarding EU policy towards Israel. The EU, according to Von der Leyen, “...Europe must lead the way - just as it has done before.” In this admission, Von der Leyen acknowledges that this new foreign policy towards Israel will require the EU to walk alone. The EU is no stranger to radical policy that requires solitude. The EU Green New Deal and the EU’s policy towards refugees are some of the most progressive policies in the world, showing that they can take that bold initiative.
