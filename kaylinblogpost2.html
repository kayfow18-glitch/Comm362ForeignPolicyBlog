    <h2>A “Jettenson” to the Center: What’s Next for the Netherlands and its Foreign Policy?</h2>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>November 2nd</em></p>

    <p>
    The Netherlands has always been a small country with a substantial diplomatic footprint: pro-European, pro-market, and often unexpectedly setting the tone for European Union (EU) coalitions in Brussels. The October 29, 2025, parliamentary election appears to have given that mantle the second wind it requires to sail on. After two years of tumultuous politics, in which the far-right Partij voor de Vrijheid (Party for Freedom, PVV) won remarkably under Geert Wilders, that short-lived government experiment has now come to an end (Bego, 2025). Dutch voters have handed a striking rebound victory to the centre-left, to the Democraten 66 (Democrats 66, D66) and its charismatic young leader, Rob Jetten (Meijer, et al., 2025). The miraculous rebound of centre politics opens the chance for the Netherlands to reclaim a stabilizing, values-driven voice in European foreign policy, something it has lacked in the past two years due to political instability. This idea hinges on whether policymakers in The Hague and Brussels view it as an opportunity, rather than a definite outcome.
    </p>

    <p>
      This recovery to the center significantly matters for three reasons. First, the Netherlands is a policy agenda setter within the EU; it is a vital trading nation that sets precedent for ensuring other member states are aware of the EU's agenda on most policy areas (Government of the Netherlands, 2025). Secondly, the Dutch political system, which supports the rule of law, means that any decision made in The Hague directly reverberates through EU policy rooms in Brussels (Government of the Netherlands, 2025). Third, the stakes of this election are uncharacteristically high: Europe is at the forefront of dealing with an invigorated Russia; a transatlantic partnership that is constantly in flux and continually rebuilding itself; and a growing sense of intercontinental populist ideology that seeks to capitalize on leftist incumbent discontent (Beznosiuk, 2025; Bergmann, 2025; Cliffe et al., 2025). A confident, headstrong, center-liberal Dutch government posture would strengthen multilateralism in The Hague and in Brussels. At a time when the best answer is unknown, a powerful actor for EU action would provide stability in a time of uncertainty. 
    </p>

      <p>
    However, the importance of this moment depends on what is actually translated into tangible policy. D66 and Jetten ran on a well-balanced mix of changing the status quo around domestic goods (the housing crisis in particular and education) and a pro-European Union, liberal internationalist stance (Verhelst, 2025,[Dutch Debate]; Cokelaere & Verhelst, 2025; Kirby & Holligan, 2025). The surge of the centre-left showed that voters were becoming impatient with the government, or lack thereof, under Wilders, and that the far-right experiment in the Netherlands was over; Dutch voters sought functional problem-solving over making their politics a spectacle for the world to watch. D66’s and Jetten’s ascendance to becoming the new Dutch Prime Minister is no mere fluke, but presents a unique challenge forthcoming. Placing Jetten in this situation places a pro-EU actor at the center of what will become a complex coalition-building issue.
        </p>

    <p>
      Building this D-66 coalition will not be easy, but Jetten is confident that he will be able to put together a government (van den Berg et al., 2025). D66 has stated that if they were to emerge victorious in these elections, they would attempt to form a broad coalition, true to their party's principles (Meijer, 2025). Based on current results, this coalition would have a majority in the Dutch Parliament, but it would be fragile. The Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie (People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, VVD) has stated multiple times that it would never work with the GroenLinks–PvdA (GreenLeft–Labour, GL/PvdA) due to disputes over tax policy (Meijer, 2025). Both of these parties, which are predicted to have 22 and 20 seats, respectively, would have to work together for Jetten’s potential broad coalition to succeed.
    </p>
    The last party needed for this coalition to have a majority is the Christen-Democratisch Appèl (Christian Democratic Appeal, CDA), with 18 seats. This party shares similar values with the D66, so it is most likely that the CDA and the D66 have no broader problems forming a coalition, at least among the two parties. There are other coalition possibilities, such as a centre-right coalition, but Jetten has said that this is not his first choice, and it would also be unstable. Given the complexity and uncertainty of what the Dutch government could look like, it will most likely take months for a coalition to form. However, any parties that decide to join a D66-led coalition will determine whether Jetten’s voice is loud in Brussels or simply constrained to domestic politics in The Hague.
