    <h2>Historical Outliers: Why China Won’t Independently Seize Taiwan’s Outlying Islands</h2>

    <p>
      	Ukraine’s plight is often compared to that of Taiwan’s, sometimes without merit. It is tempting to want to compare the two, not least because China and Russia are increasingly colluding, even in the context of a potential invasion of Taiwan as recent document leaks have revealed. (Danylyuk & Watling, 2025) One comparison often raised is the threat of land seizures short of conflict as seen in 2014 when Russia illegally seized Crimea with little consequence or penalty from the international community. This comparison is not totally without reason for concern, indeed the majority of cross-Strait tension since 1949 has involved attempts by the PRC to seize Taiwan’s outlying islands. (Office of the Historian, ND)
        </p>
      
    <p>
      	Despite this, Taiwan’s outlying islands have remained under Taiwanese control, even in the face of decades of strong modernization in the People’s Liberation Army. So, if the PRC has the military capability to seize these small islands, why have they refrained from doing so? The reason for this unique situation boils down to several fundamental trends in the cross-Strait relationship. 
  </p> 

    </p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>Historical Lessons</strong></p>
    <p>
      Following the 1949 collapse of their military in mainland China, the Republic of China nationalist forces fled to Taiwan, maintaining garrisons on several outlying islands during their retreat including the islands of Kinmen, Wuqiu, Matsu, and Penghu. In 1954 and 1958, the PRC challenged Taiwan for control of these islands, attempting to occupy them and firing thousands of rounds of artillery into the surrounding areas. (Office of the Historian, ND)

      <p>
      These campaigns may well have been successful, even despite the antiquated state of the People’s Liberation Army at the time, had it not been for the large intervention of the United States. During all three Strait crises, the United States sent considerable military forces to the region to directly prevent the PLA from seizing the islands. These forces were organized under the United States Taiwan Defense Command (USTDC), and even included stationed nuclear weapons on the island at one point at one point. (Taiwan Security Monitor, 2025) 
    </p>
      <p>
      However, the United States commitment to Taiwan took a nosedive following official recognition of the People’s Republic of China in 1979. The USTDC was disbanded, and the American military footprint on Taiwan vanished, taking the credible threat of American intervention along with it. America did not disappear from cross-Strait relations, though. They still asserted a prominent role in the 1995-1996 Third Taiwan Strait Crisis, as mentioned previously. This commitment was considerably smaller than prior commitments, being constrained to only enhanced military presence in the region and strong words of condemnation. 
    </p>
      <p>
        In recent years, this ambiguity has increasingly lost credibility. Not only has the PLA experienced a paradigmatic shift in its size and capabilities, but American military presence has correspondedly dwindled substantially in the region. (Hart, 2025) Seeing this, the PRC has indeed become more bold in its pressure campaigns around Taiwan’s outlying islands. Through the so-called “Joint-Exercises”, coast guard pressure, and political warfare, the PRC has sought to undermine Taiwan’s political stability and commitment to its outlying islands. Importantly though, this has not translated into genuine attempts or even noticeable plans to seize these islands independent of larger action against Taiwan. 
            </p>

      
</p><pclass="fake-header left-align"><strong>In For a Penny, In For a Pound</strong></p>
    <p>
      	The reason for this is simple: the seizure of Kinmen or any other outlying island would spell a permanent end to the possibility of peaceful unification while offering little strategic gain. This is where Taiwan departs from Ukraine’s historical example. Crimea, often called a “bastion” in Russian military writing, offered Russia substantial military benefit when it was seized, allowing a new route to invade Ukraine and increasing its dominance over the Black Sea. 
</p>
  <p>
      	Taiwan’s islands do not hold these same potential benefits. Besides perhaps Penghu, the majority of the islands are close to China’s own coast, offer little convertible military infrastructure, and do not hold a substantial amount of Taiwanese forces. In this way, the fact that Taiwan is incapable of seriously offering a defense of the island is its own deterrent, meaning China would gain little from an invasion while potentially opening itself up to international pressure and retribution from the United States. 
    </p>
   <p>
      	There is a larger logic at play, however. The seizure of these islands would spell a permanent end to China’s decades long attempt at peaceful unification. Overtly aggressive acts such as land seizure would embolden Taiwan’s anti-China forces, and likely accelerate support from the United States. This is not to say these islands are safe forever, just that they are unlikely to face serious military pressure short of a larger campaign against Taiwan. If such a campaign or invasion were to occur, the islands would surely be seized in the opening hours, with likely minimal casualties on both sides.
