    <h2>Who Are Jewish Voices for Peace and how has 10/7 Impacted them?</h2>

      Jewish Voices for Peace, or JVP for short, was founded in 1996 by three Jewish undergraduate students at the University of California, Berkley. Initially founded as an all-volunteer group, they shifted in 2002 to “build a larger grassroots base that could one day change U.S. policies towards the region” (Jewish Voice for Peace, n.d.). The group denounces modern day Zionism as a “settler-colonist movement,” that created the Israeli apartheid state that awards Jews more rights than others (Jewish Voice for Peace, 2023). They also advocate for the Palestinian right of return, which is the political position or principle that Palestinian refugees have “the right to return home without restriction and to regain possession of their property,” allowing refugees to reunite with their families, communities (Adelman & Barkan, 2011, p. 203). The group differentiates itself from other Jewish grassroots organization by this opposition to Zionism as a concept, the declaration of Israel as an apartheid state, and by supporting the Boycott, Divest, and Sanction (BDS) movement against the State of Israel. The group also opposes and refuses to “see the safety of our communities threatened so the Israeli government can continue to evade accountability for perpetrating atrocities against Palestinians” (Jewish Voice for Peace, n.d.). JVP also understands the importance of being a Jewish-led organization in the Palestinian liberation movement by working to “to answer the call of [their] Palestinian partners to build a Jewish movement that can effectively form a counterweight to the Jewish Zionist support” (Jewish Voice for Peace, n.d.). The group’s stated position and role in the Palestinian freedom movement is to shake the alliance between the US and Israel by breaking and impacting the financial, political, and cultural Jewish support for the apartheid and Zionism. According to their own 2024 Annual Report, JVP undertook over one thousand “actions” in at least twenty-five cities across the country since October 2023 (Jewish Voice for Peace, 2024). In that same time, the group grew to include over 750,000 members, with 2,300,000 followers on social media platforms, and even delivered 1,100,000 email publications (Jewish Voice for Peace, 2024).

      According to their own 2024 Annual Report, JVP undertook over one thousand “actions” in at least twenty-five cities across the country since October 2023 (Jewish Voice for Peace, 2024). During the same time, the group grew to include over 750,000 members, with 2,300,000 followers on social media platforms, and even delivered 1,100,000 email publications (Jewish Voice for Peace, 2024). One of the first actions undertaken by JVP was a protest organized with fellow pro-Palestinian organization IfNotNow almost two weeks after 10/7 on October 16th, where roughly a thousand people marched around the White House, blocking entrances in a show of civil disobedience, urging then-President Biden to call for a ceasefire. The protest even saw actor Wallace Shaw, most famous for Toy Story and The Princess Bride, speak in front of the crowd sharing how he does not “believe in revenge,” and how he “thinks we’re all here because we don’t believe in massacring innocent people…[w]hat’s happening right now is certainly one of the most deliberate cruelties inflicted on a group” (White, 2023, para. 3 and 6).  Later that October, on the 27th, JVP organized a protest in New York’s Grand Central Terminal, where an estimated 1,000 people showed up chanting phrases like “Cease-fire now” and “Let Gaza Live” as well as hanging and holding posters that said things such as “Palestinians should be free” and “Israelis demand cease-fire now” (Fahy, Roberts-Grmela, & Piccoli, 2023). Although the protest did not cause any reported train delays, the entrance was blocked and people’s evening commutes were disrupted for roughly 40 minutes (Fahy, Roberts-Grmela, & Piccoli, 2023). The protest would die down around 7 p.m. when police begun informing people to leave and started to detain hundreds of protestors, where in the end 335 people were taken into custody. A few days later, on November 6th, around 500 protestors organized by JVP conducted a sit-in demonstration at the Statue of Liberty, again demanding a ceasefire in Gaza. The Statue of Liberty was specifically chosen because of its symbolic value of immigration and immigrant history in the United States, according to JVP-NYC spokesperson Sarah Koshar. Koshar elaborated on this symbolism, explaining how her “ancestors were greeted by the Statue of Liberty while escaping pogroms…am hauntingly aware that the US denied Jewish refugees throughout the entirety of the Holocaust” ending how “[f]rom Ellis Island to Gaza, never again means never again – for anyone” (Luscombe, 2023).

      JVP does not exclusively do physical events and protests, however, as the group has multiple online and digital campaigns and movements. The most recent of these campaigns, beginning September 23 of this year, is the “Tell Delaware AG: Investigate Gaza Humanitarian Foundation!” wherein the group calls for members, supporters, and readers to write the Delaware AG now “to demand she investigate and act to dissolve GHF’s corporate charter” (Jewish Voice for Peace, n.d., para. 4). This campaign came in not long after the non-profit Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) sent a letter to the Delaware AG, asking her to “enforce Delaware law by investigating the GHF, and upon finding a credible basis exists, using your authority…revoke GHF’s charter” (Center for Constitutional Rights, 2025, p. 1). In the letter, the CCR outlined how “through its complicity in war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity, GHF has abused the cooperate powers and privileges grants by Delaware,” arguing how “knowingly providing services that have a substantial effect…constitutes complicity or aiding and abetting for international law violations,” as well as stating how “there is overwhelming evidence the GHT is contributing to forcible transfer, killing, extermination, and genocide of the Palestinian population in Gaza” (Center for Constitutional Rights, 2025, p. 2 and 13). Both the JVP campaign page and the CCR letter were themselves responses, as well as cite, United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) report that was published July of this year, detailing how “in total, since May 27, 1,373 Palestinians have been killed while seeking food; 859 in the vicinity of the GHF sites and 514 along the routes of food convoys” with the OHCHR stating they have “no evidence that these Palestinians were directly participating in hostilities or posed any threat to Israeli security forces” (Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, 2025, para. 3 and 4).
